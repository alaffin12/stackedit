# Bastion Rules
## Base Rules
Every session represents "one week" of bastion time (we explain it away as time flows differently on different planes).  
Each week players will have the option to activate different benefits of different facilities (which could result in bonuses changing mid-battle - might have to be looked into).  

Each facility has an upkeep cost associated with it that is paid whether or not it is used during a week.  It may have further costs for different benefits.  

Facilities can be changed and upgraded as needed (although they will require money and downtime to do this).

During an attack on the bastion roll the appropriate dice for the attack.  For every "1" rolled a facility (at random) is disabled for the week.

One benefit per facility per week.  

Mordenkainen's Bastion in Sigil starts with with following:
* Mundane Facilities (Bedrooms, Kitchen, Living Space etc.)
* Mordenkainen's Orrey of the Multiverse
* Library
