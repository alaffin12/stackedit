# Bastion Rules
## Base Rules
* Every session represents "one week" of bastion time (we explain it away as time flows differently on different planes).  
* Each week players will have the option to activate different benefits of different facilities (which could result in bonuses changing mid-battle - might have to be looked into).  
* Each facility has an upkeep cost associated with it that is paid whether or not it is used during a week.  It may have further costs for different benefits.  
* Facilities can be built and upgraded as needed (although they will require money and downtime to do this).  There is no limit on the number of facilities that the bastion can have - however only one facility can be under construction/upgrade at any given time.
* A maximum of five facilities may be used in any given week, regardless of the number of facilities present.
* During an attack on the bastion roll the appropriate dice for the attack.  For every "1" rolled a facility (at random) is disabled for the week.
* Each facility can be used to produce a maximum of one benefit per week.  
* Each player can receive the maximum of one 'active' benefit per week ('active' in this context meaning bonuses to their character - if a facility is used to produce an item or gold then all may benefit from it.
