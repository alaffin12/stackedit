Everyone starts with a boon:

### Nakos the Returned
*Working with Zyblina is... not the easiest task for you.  Her nature is mercurial, and she takes great delight in annoying you, sending you on trivial tasks and making you do work that is well beneath both your skill set and your status as Knight of the Witchlight Court.  And then there's the fae politics.  It's trouble."*

*As a kind of a jab at you Zyblina has given you wings.  Not draconic wings, or even feathered wings like your former companion Squash.  She has given you a great big pair of frail-looking, stained-glass-like butterfly wings.  Or 'Fairy Wings' as she call them.  Even though you not she does not have such wings.  They are practically useless - you can't fly while wearing anything resembling armour.  And because your form is not exactly built for flight you move rather slowly and clumsily.  But you can fly, you suppose...*

*You have also noticed that you are... more than what you once were.  Or less.  Since you were reanimated by fairy magic you are not exactly undead.  But you have some things in common with the undead nonetheless.  You are harder to kill, able to keep pushing forward while others would have stopped.*

* **Wings.**  You have giant fairy wings on your back.  You can fly at half-your movement (walking) speed if you are wearing no armor or light armor.  Otherwise the wings are mostly ornamental.
* **Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

### *Leslie (Name Unknown)*
*You are a survivor of Cyre, but it scarred you.  You have learned to cope with the loss of your homeland, your people, your family.  But there are times when it feels like it will drown you in a sea of depression.  You have learned to take that pain, that hole in your soul, and turn it into raw psionic energy - the same stuff as your blades, but far more powerful and far less controlled.  When you let yourself feel that pain - when you touch that black void - the psionic energy flows through you, and other get to experience a fraction of your suffering.*

* **Mourning Blast.** Once per long rest, as an action, you can unleash a blast of distorted psychic force. All creatures of your choice in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency + your Intelligence modifier) or take 6d10 psychic damage and be blinded until the end of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage and are not blinded.  Constructs and creatures with no Intelligence score are immune. Creatures native to the Mournland have advantage.
