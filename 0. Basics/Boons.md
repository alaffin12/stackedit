Everyone starts with a boon:

### Nakos the Returned
*Working with Zyblina is... not the easiest task for you.  Her nature is mercurial, and she takes great delight in annoying you, sending you on trivial tasks and making you do work that is well beneath both your skill set and your status as Knight of the Witchlight Court.  And then there's the fae politics.  It's trouble."*

*As a kind of a jab at you Zyblina has given you wings.  Not draconic wings, or even feathered wings like your former companion Squash.  She has given you a great big pair of frail-looking, stained-glass-like butterfly wings.  Or 'Fairy Wings' as she call them.  Even though you not she does not have such wings.  They are practically useless - you can't fly while wearing anything resembling armour.  And because your form is not exactly built for flight you move rather slowly and clumsily.  But you can fly, you suppose...*

*You have also noticed that you are... more than what you once were.  Or less.  Since you were reanimated by fairy magic you are not exactly undead.  But you have some things in common with the undead nonetheless.  You are harder to kill, able to keep pushing forward while others would have stopped.*

* **Wings.**  You have giant fairy wings on your back.  You can fly at half-your movement (walking) speed if you are wearing no armor or light armor.  Otherwise the wings are mostly ornamental.
* **Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

### *Leslie (Name Unknown)*
*You are a survivor of Cyre, but it scarred you.  You have learned to cope with the loss of your homeland, your people, your family.  But there are times when it feels like it will drown you in a sea of depression.  You have learned to take that pain, that hole in your soul, and turn it into raw psionic energy - the same stuff as your blades, but far more powerful and far less controlled.  When you let yourself feel that pain - when you touch that black void - the psionic energy flows through you, and others get to experience a fraction of your suffering.*

* **Mourning Blast.** Once per long rest, as an action, you can unleash a blast of distorted psychic force. All creatures of your choice in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency + your Intelligence modifier) or take 6d10 psychic damage and be blinded until the end of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage and are not blinded.  Constructs and creatures with no Intelligence score are immune. Creatures native to the Mournland have advantage.

### Mazirak Clanbane
*Working for the Prince of Nessus has its advantages.  Others have learned the Bladesong from lesser masters, but your baritone rumble was honed in the infernal choir.  When your foes miss you, they learn to regret it...*

* **Hellfire Counter.** Once per short rest, when a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to unleash a hellfire-infused counterattack.  The attacker takes 3d6 fire damage, and must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be blinded by searing infernal light until the end of their next turn.

### *Jane (Name Unknown)*
*You no longer server the divine through ritual.  The woman of the cloth that you once were - the woman that stumbled across the field of battle and learned the true price of war - is long gone, as are the trappings of holiness.  You still serve a higher power, but you do it on your own terms.  Your healing is not soft - it sears wounds like fire cutting through shadow.  When you choose to heal, your enemies feel it.*

* **Burning Grace.** Once per long rest you may enter a state of Burning Grace for one minute as a bonus action.  While in this state, when you use any ability that restores hit points (i.e. *cast cure wounds, use healing light*) you may add your Charisma modifier to the healing (if you already add your charisma modifier to the healing you may add it a second time).  Additionally, when you heal an ally you may choose one enemy within 10 ft. of that ally - that enemy take radiant damage equal to the healing done (no save, once per turn).  Finally, allies you heal during this state gain advantage on their next saving throw before the end of their next turn.
