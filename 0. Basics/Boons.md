Everyone starts with a boon:

**Nakos the Returned:**
*Working with Zyblina is... not the easiest task for you.  Her nature is mercurial, and she takes great delight in annoying you, sending you on trivial tasks and making you do work that is well beneath both your skill set and your status as Knight of the Witchlight Court.  And then there's the fae politics.  It's trouble."*

*As a kind of a jab at you Zyblina has given you wings.  Not draconic wings, or even feathered wings like your former companion Squash.  She has given you a great big pair of frail-looking, stained-glass-like butterfly wings.  Or 'Fairy Wings' as she call them.  Even though you not she does not have such wings.  They are practically useless - you can't fly while wearing anything resembling armour.  And because your form is not exactly built for flight you move rather slowly and clumsily.  But you can fly, you suppose...*

*You have also noticed that you are... more than what you once were.  Or less.  Since you were reanimated by fairy magic you are not exactly undead.  But you have some things in common with the undead nonetheless.  You are harder to kill, able to keep pushing forward while others would have stopped.*
