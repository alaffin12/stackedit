# Murder on the Zilargo Express
https://www.hipstersanddragons.com/murder-mystery-adventures-dnd/
## Setup
Players begin in Mordenkainen's Bastion in Sigil, presumably with the understanding that (a) Mordenkainen is gone and (b) it now falls to them to save the multiverse.  Fortunately they have access to Mordenkainen's vast library, collection of notes on a wide variety of subjects, and the Orrey of the Spheres to help them

### Finding the Next Step
This may require some GM prodding.  The players have to decide to save the multiverse themselves and realize that Mordenkainen's bastion contains the answers they need.  The bastion itself can provide this information - can communicate with them and help them look for information.

Eventually the party will come across some notes of Mordenkainen's notes which point them to their next stop - Eberron:

> What a stupid thing, the Ritual of Remaking.  Who could have possibly thought that the multiverse would be so fragile that such a simple spell - something even a novice could cast - could undo it all.  Fortunately it is mostly self-correcting.  It is easy enough to pull on the loose threads of creation, it is much more difficult to do so without unravelling one's self.  Of course leave it to Vecna to work out how to do it.  One hates to admit it, but that contemptible lich has a knack for finding loopholes to exploit.  The trick is to unravel everything slowly!
> Of course that simply invites more questions, like how does one unravel the fabric of reality slowly.  And why do we insist on using textiles as a metaphor for existence?  The latter is beyond me, but as to the former - the trick is to use reality to slow itself down!  Consider, that in every realm I have ever had the fortune or misfortune to visit, there has been a quirk to the realm.  Something foundational, that represents the its distinct character.  You might call it a foundation myth, or a core truth.  I call them foundational secrets, for I have found that - almost universally - these facts are almost always obscured from the common understanding.  This might even be a necessity - after all, why would the average Joe on the street want or need to know how their realm was distinct from another that they have never even heard of.
> To continue with the textiles metaphor, these foundational secrets represent knots in the thread.  Some are larger than others, but if one could control the knot at the heart of a larger realm - say a Faerun or a Oerth - and control how it is understood then they could use it to unwind reality more slowly and thereby control the Ritual of Remaking.
> And of course, it's Vecna.  Secrets are his bread and butter.
> So it falls to Mordenkainen to defend the cosmos.  I have devised a plan of attack.  I have crafted a tome located in the heart of my library.  I call it the Book of True Balance.  Into it I can pour my knowledge of these foundational secrets, thereby preventing Vecna from manipulating them.
> Of course I must gain that knowledge first.  I must find the right secrets before that.  I say right secrets, because not every secret is worthy of my attention - some realms simply do not have the metaphysical power to serve either Vecna's needs or my own.  They are not strong enough to slow the Ritual of Remaking in an appreciable way.  They are not strong enough to serve as a bulwark against Vecna's plans.  Oerth and Faerun will surely be represented.  But what secrets form a part of their foundation?  And where else will I look in the infinity of creation?
> Eberron.  The Day of Mourning.  Understanding that event must be one that I can use.

Presumably the players will want to simply hop to Eberron to follow the plot.  However it will take them some time to get the Orrey of the Spheres working and they may take some time to get familiar with Eberron (if no one from the party is from Eberron).  Here is a sample of Mordenkainen's writing on Eberron:

> Ah, Eberron—a realm where magic is not just the province of sages, but is the lifeblood of civilization itself! In this world of wonders, arcane innovation powers gleaming cities like Sharn and fuels the Lightning Rail that connects far-flung lands. Yet this marvelous realm bears the scars of the Last War, a century of brutal conflict that tore kingdoms asunder and left deep wounds across the continent of Khorvaire. The war's most terrible legacy is the Day of Mourning, when the thriving nation of Cyre was obliterated in a cataclysm of unknown origin. Now a blighted wasteland known as the Mournland, Cyre’s haunting ruins and unnatural phenomena serve as both a grim warning and an enduring mystery.
> The Day of Mourning casts a long shadow over Eberron, coloring every alliance, every ambition. While the Treaty of Thronehold has brought a tenuous peace to the surviving nations, suspicion festers and secrets abound. The dragonmarked houses, wielding arcane sigils of power, continue to manipulate trade and politics, while whispers of the Draconic Prophecy echo through ancient ruins, hinting at fates both dire and grand. Beneath the surface, factions like the Lords of Dust and the Dreaming Dark scheme in shadow, while the Mournland itself draws adventurers and treasure-seekers to its perilous depths. In Eberron, the line between hero and villain is ever blurred, for in the wake of the Mourning, survival often means making choices as dangerous as the land itself.
> If only it weren't so damn hard to get to!  Even the gods have trouble reaching that plane.  Thankfully I have the Orrey of the Spheres, but if it were not for that tool I might not be able to reach that realm at all.

##### Notes for Travelling to Eberron
Eberron is warded against the intrusion of deities that are not from that sphere.  During their morning prayers/refresh of spell slots clerics of deities who are not native to Eberron must roll a percentile dice for every spell slot they wish to recover.  If they roll less than **(Spell Level-2) x 12** on the percentile dice they cannot recover that spell slot for that day as the distance between them and their deity is too great.  Clerics can investigate the religions of Eberron and possibly find a deity who resonates with them.  They may also try to contact their power, expending a 2nd level slot at the start of the day (2nd level slots automatically recharge as per above) to intensify their connection with their deity, reducing the number they need to roll to recover spell slots by 20 for that day (alternatively they may sacrifice a higher level slot for a bigger bonus equal to 10 x Spell Slot used).

When they eventually travel to Eberron they will arrive in Sharn, the City of Towers.  They may explore the city, but if they ask about finding out the history of the Day of Mourning they will be directed to Morgrave University, and within the University, to Professor Samuel Edward House of the History Department.

> **Samuel Edward House** is a distinguished scholar at Morgrave University, known for his piercing intellect and unyielding dedication to understanding the turbulent history of the Last War. With a focus on the enigmatic Day of Mourning, his lectures captivate students with vivid accounts of battles, political intrigue, and the haunting mystery of Cyre's fall. Though his sharp wit and critical tone often ruffle feathers among his peers, Professor House is widely respected for his meticulous research and his efforts to uncover the truth behind one of Eberron's greatest tragedies.

The party will have to decide how to approach the professor - do they outright tell him all of Eberron is at stake?  Do they tell him they are from other worlds altogether?  Here are some specific thoughts as to how he will responds to certain questions:
* *If the party tells them they are from another realm:* He finds their story a bit suspect - although there are some scholars who theorize that there are other realms beyond the Ring of Siberys, he does not believe such twaddle.  However he understands the need for secrecy and will respect their privacy.
*  *If the party warns of a multiversal threat from Vecna*: He's never heard of a 'Vecna' but he knows that there are dangers out there that he is unaware of.  If the party is concerned about this character they should seek the Church of the Silver Flame - or perhaps the Gatekeepers.  They would be better suited to deal with dangers like that.
* *If the party says they want to know the truth of what happened during the Day of Mourning*: He will comment that their request is not exactly a small ask.  Exactly what happened on the Day of Mourning was likely known to only a few people, and they were killed.  Any survivors are not going to be exactly talkative - who in their right mind would want to be associated with that?

Eventually he will make the party a proposition.  Sitting back in his chair and tenting his finger, he'll think for a moment before talking.
>**"Look, you are not asking for some simple thing.  It happened only four years ago, but from a certain point of view it has already moved from history to myth.  There are so many tales about it - the Light on the Saerun Road.  The Mists of Metrol.  Cyre 1313.  From the point of view of a historian it is fascinating.  And utterly frustrating.  Myth and legend do not history make."**
> **"There is an individual who I have long desired to question.  I suspect he is a survivor of the Day of Mourning.  I suspect he knows more or less what transpired on that day.  He is, however, reclusive.  Violently so.  He dwells in the Mournlands - the smoking ruins of a once great nation.  It is not a nice place to live.  It is not an easy place to live.  And so my questions go unanswered."**
> **"I cannot promise you the answers you seek.  My theories about who this individual is and what this individual knows are just that - theories.  And it will most certainly not be safe.  As I said, this individual is violently reclusive.  That - and the dangers posed by the Mournlands - are why I have not gone to see him myself.  But you look like you can handle yourselves.  If you will escort me to him then we can talk to him together, and perhaps solve the mystery of what happened on that dreadful day.**

If asked to give up the name of the individual now he will smile at the party:

> **"Understand friends, I am putting my life in your hands - the Mournlands are a dangerous place, and our target doubly so.  But I am not a fool.  For this part of the journey I need you far more than you need me.  And I cannot discount the possibility that you are working on behalf of an academic rival, simply looking to publish before I can.  Some of my peers are foolish - I would be happy to work with them, to publish with them, to share the glory and fame.  But what can one do?  I tell you what - when we get to the Mournlands I will tell you.  You might still kill me and leave me there, but by then I suspect I will either trust you enough to tell you, or have called the whole thing off altogether."**

## Crunchy Bits
Refer to this section for general information that might be needed for flavor, but is not vital to the adventure!

### Lightning Rail
Professor House should handle most of the travel arrangements, but if the players choose to involve themselves, this section will give some detail.

The party will be taking a two part trip to Vathirond, which borders the Mournlands.  Unfortunately there is no line that runs direct from Sharn to Vathiron so they will have to take a trip from Sharn to Starilaskur, then another from Starilaskur to Vathirond, with the section between Sharn and Starilaskur (on the epynomynous "Zilargo Express") being where the murder takes place.  Below is a table which gives the general travel times between stations and the price of the trips (in copper).  Regardless of how it happens players should be encouraged to take second class accomodations (first class is full, steerage is full of people and the DM has no intention of trying to create that many NPCs on the fly) and the trip should be scheduled so that the players are on the long Wroat to Starilaskur leg overnight.

| Line | Station | Time | Steerage | 2nd Class | 1st  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Sharn - Korranberg | Sharn | - | - | - | - |
| - | First Tower | 1h 15m | 112 | 750 | 1870 |
| - | Wroat | 6h 53m | 619 | 4125 | 10320 | 
| - | Starilaskur | 19h 10m | 1725 | 11500 | 28750 |
| Starilaskur - Aruldusk | Starilaskur | - | - |
| - | Vathirond | 6h 3m | 544 | 3625 | 9065 |

If the party goes way off book, you can check the following for ideas about how to fix their mistakes:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eberron/comments/13y2ufy/lightning_rail_route_times_costs_and_train_names/

### Train Layout
On the train first and second class are kept together, as there is not enough first class passengers to keep and serve them separate.  The big difference between first and second class is the qulity of accomodations - first class berths are larger, sleep one person, have better furnishings and come with a small elemental furance which allows someone occupying the room to keep it as warm or as cold as they like.  Second class berths are smaller, sleep two people, and have a single heating system which will inevitably be a source of frustration for the players.  Most importantly (for this mystery) first and second class eat and socialize together.  Steerage is another matter.  We are not going to steerage.  There are too many NPCs.  Stop asking.

The train is laid out like this:

**Engine & Associated Cars**

**2nd Class Baggage Car**

**2nd Class Car**
Berth 1: Empty
Berth 2: Party #1
Berth 3: Lidda d'Jorasco/Exagora
Berth 4: Party #2

**Dining Car**

**Social Car**

**First Class Car**
Berth 1: Lady Natalia ir'Vincan
Berth 2: Baron Rudolph ir'Wynarn
Berth 3: Lady Helena ir'Wynarn
Berth 4: Professor Samuel Edward House

**1st Class Baggage Car**

**Crew Car**
Bouc d'Orien, Cyrus d'Orien

**Steerage (the door to steerage is locked to keep the plebs where they belong - not in the adventure)**

## The Cast of Characters
Everyone has a secret...

---
#### Professor Samuel Edward House - The Victim
---
The helpful, if a bit haughty, university professor.  He is guiding the party to the Mournlands, and will tell them who their target is when they get closer.  As a character he's rather milquetoast - he exists mainly to die in the scenario, and provide lore-dumps elsewhere.  

---
### Bouc d'Orien - The Chief Steward
---
_Middle Aged, Male, Half-Elf, Short Frizzy Hair, Short, Slim Build, Uniformed_

**Personality:** Bouc is charming, gregarious, and takes pride in his position as chief steward aboard the Zilargo Express. He often uses humor and friendliness to put passengers at ease, masking a deep insecurity about being a member of House Orien without a dragonmark. Bouc is eager to prove his worth to the house and demonstrate his capability despite the stigma.
**Secret:** Bouc was expelled from Margrave University (where Professor House teaches) after being caught cheating during an exam. In fact, Bouc cheated a great deal during his time at Margrave, but not because he was incapable - he was simply terrified of failing.  The arrival of a professor from Margrave puts Bouc on edge - he lives in constant fear that the scandal will be uncovered and tarnish his already precarious standing within House Orien.
**Overheard Clue:** During boarding when Bouc offers Professor House a 1st Class Berth players who make a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check notice that he is especially nervous about dealing with Professor House.
**Conversation Clue:** If the players try to bring up Bouc's time at Margrave will find them put off.  "Oh, old times.  Yes - but my days as a student are done now."  A DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check notices Bouc is pretty desperate to change the subject.
**Nighttime Clue:** Players here Bouc muttering "Keep yourself calm Bouc.  He's not here to ruin you..."
**Cabin Clue:** If the players search the chief stewards compartment and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigate) check they will find a letter written in the shaky hand.  The letter reads "You owe your position to lies, not skill.  But some of us haven't forgotten what happened at Margrave."
**Luggage Clue:** Bouc does not have any luggage on board.

---
### Carrie Suffolk - The Widow
---
_Middle Aged, Female, Human, Widows Peak, Short, Stout Build_

**Personality:** Carrie is a vivacious and opinionated widow with a knack for storytelling and a flair for the dramatic. She thrives on attention and isn’t shy about sharing tales of her life, though she tends to embellish them. She exudes maternal energy, frequently fussing over other passengers and offering unsolicited advice. However, her seemingly open nature hides a steely cunning and an iron will when it comes to protecting herself or those she cares about.
**Secret:** Carrie is not a widow at all but a spy working for the Brelish Crown, tasked with gathering intelligence on suspected anti-monarchist conspirators aboard the Lightning Rail. Her dramatic demeanor and constant chattering serve as a cover to deflect suspicion while she discreetly observes and eavesdrops.
**Overheard Clue:** If players overhear Carrie talking during boarding they hear her say "Oh, darling, do help me with my luggage! It’s full of precious mementos from my dear late husband. I’d be lost without them!".  They also notice that the bags do not look that heavy.
**Conversation Clue:** If the players talk to Carrie they might notice (DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check) that small details of her story keep changing.  Notably about her husband - in some tellings he was a soldier who died during the Last War, in others he was a travelling merchant who fell ill.
**Nighttime Clue:** If the players hear Carrie's nighttime clue whoever is in player berth #1 overhears the click of a lock opening and footsteps walking along the hallway.  They will hear someone muttering "the crown will want to know about this"
**Cabin Clue:** If the players search Carrie's berth and make a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigate) check they will find that her jewelry box has a false bottom.  The note is written in coded text that is not easily deciphered (DC 16 Intelligence check).  If it is deciphered it seems to be a list of names, locations and notes like "possible asset", "sympathizer" and "traitor".
**Luggage Clue:** Tucked in Carrie's luggage is a pair of spectacles which if examined have a mild aura of divination.  Anyone wearing them can see hidden writing or magical auras.

### Bright - The Nanny
---
_Unknowable Age, Female?, Warforged, No Hair, Average Height, Made of Stone and Wood Mostly_

**Personality:** Bright, a warforged governess, is calm, practical, and composed, always maintaining an air of professionalism. Their words are measured, and they often act as a voice of reason when tensions rise. However, Bright’s stoic exterior can seem overly detached or cold, as they carefully avoid discussing personal matters. They are efficient and self-assured, driven by an unwavering sense of duty. Their logical mind contrasts with an underlying anxiety about their past, which they guard fiercely.
**Secret**: Bright is en route to Starilaskur not for a new job but to escape the consequences of their involvement in a clandestine operation during the Last War. While working as a covert courier for House Cannith, they transported dangerous experimental weapons disguised as medical supplies. A shipment they delivered caused immense devastation in an unintended detonation, and Bright has since been haunted by their role. They fear someone aboard the train might recognize them or uncover the truth about their past actions.
**Overheard Clue:** While boarding you hear someone (Anthony d'Cannith) talking to themselves “I swear I’ve seen that warforged before. Weren’t they working for us during the war?”
**Conversation Clue:** Any discussion with Bright about her past, or the Last War in general, brings up her defenses.  "I see no reason why my past should be the subject of conversation here".  Players making a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check notice she's very defensive about her past.
**Nighttime Clue:** If players hear Bright's nighttime clue they hear mechanical footsteps in the hallway and a dull mechnical voice mumbling: "It was only a delivery... I didn’t know what they intended. I—no. No one must know."
**Cabin Clue:** If players search Bright's berth and make a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigate) check they find tucked under Bright’s cot is a map of Khorvaire, marked with the sigils of House Cannith enclaves and routes traced in red ink. One of the routes ends abruptly, noted with the word “Failure” scrawled in a corner.
**Luggage Clue:** If players search Bright's luggage and make a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigate) check they find hidden in the lining of Bright’s travel bag is a small, magically sealed Cannith ledger listing shipments of “experimental prototypes.” A specific entry is conspicuously erased, but faint traces of the words “Dagger River Incident” remain visible.

---
### Jheri Ophinshtalajiir - The Zealot
---
_Middle Aged?, Female?, Dragonborn, Hairless, Tall, Bronze Scales_

**Personality:** Jheri is a pious and compassionate friar of the Silver Flame, dedicated to spreading hope and offering comfort to those in need. They are serene and humble, often going out of their way to aid fellow passengers and bring solace to the troubled. However, their unwavering devotion has a fervent edge, and they occasionally exhibit an unsettling intensity when discussing the Flame’s divine mission.
**Secret**: Jheri is unknowingly under the influence of the Shadow in the Flame, a sinister force that corrupts some followers of the Silver Flame. During their novitiate, they sought guidance in a moment of spiritual despair and mistook the Shadow’s whispers for divine revelation. Since then, they have carried out subtle acts that sow division and mistrust, believing they are serving the Flame’s will. Jheri is unaware that their actions are guided by darkness and sincerely believes they are a righteous servant of the Flame.
**Overheard Clue:** A fellow passenger remarks, “That friar looks so kind... but something about their eyes unnerves me. It’s as if they’re hiding something.”
**Conversation Clue:** When discussing faith, Jheri says with an almost manic zeal, “The Flame burns away the unworthy and purifies the world. Those who resist must be shown the light—by any means necessary.”
**Nighttime Clue:** During the night someone hears a voice in the passageway outside their berth “They must see the truth. They must all kneel before the Flame.” 
**Cabin Clue:** If the players search Jheri's berth and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigate) check they find a blackened Silver Flame holy symbol, its edges charred and corrupted with shadowy energy. The symbol radiates a faint aura of malevolent magic to those who can sense it.
**Luggage Clue:** If players search Jheri's luggage and they make a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigate) check they find among the robes is a tattered, forbidden tome in Draconic script, detailing rituals that blend devotion to the Flame with dark invocations to the Shadow. The pages are heavily annotated (in Jheri’s handwriting, although the players will not know this), showing that someone's been studying its contents for some time.

---
###  Anthony d'Cannith - The Salesman
---
_Young, Male, Human, Short Wavy Hair, Tall, Athletic Build_

**Personality:** Anthony is a charismatic and exuberant salesman who prides himself on being the “face” of House Cannith’s burgeoning industrial products division. He’s gregarious, always ready with a smile and a story about his latest successful deal, and quick to boast about the superiority of Cannith craftsmanship. Beneath his cheerful exterior, however, Anthony is highly ambitious and fiercely determined, willing to bend rules to secure lucrative contracts. His natural charm masks a cutthroat pragmatism that can catch others off guard. 
**Secret**: Anthony was involved in selling experimental Cannith constructs to the criminal underworld during the Last War. Though it began as a desperate bid to meet quotas, he continued the dealings for personal profit even after the war ended. One of his illicit deals went horribly wrong, resulting in a catastrophic attack in Cyre shortly before the Day of Mourning. He now fears that someone aboard the train might uncover his involvement in the tragedy.
**Overheard Clue:** A bystander mutters to another, “Isn’t that Anthony d’Cannith? I heard he’s always got one foot in the grey market. House Cannith must be getting desperate to keep someone like him around.”
**Conversation Clue:** Anthony becomes defensive if questioned about his dealings during the war. He says something like, “Business is business. In wartime, you do what you must to survive. Who are we to judge the needs of others?”
**Nighttime Clue:** A hushed voice from Anthony’s cabin, as if he’s rehearsing a confession: “I didn’t know they’d use it like that. I thought they just wanted... control. Not annihilation.”
**Cabin Clue:** A torn contract with faded Cannith insignias lies crumpled in the wastebasket. The terms of the deal are vague, but the buyer’s name is redacted, and the words “high-risk delivery” are scrawled in Anthony’s handwriting.
**Luggage Clue:** Hidden beneath false-bottomed compartments in his suitcase are schematics for a long-discontinued construct model, stamped “Prototype - For Internal Use Only.” Notes in Anthony’s handwriting outline modifications to make the constructs more lethal and instructions to bypass Cannith tracking enchantments.

---
### Lady Natalia ir'Vincan - The Lady
---
_Old, Female, Human, Long Wispy Grey Hair, Average Height, Slim Build_

**Personality:** Lady Natalia ir'Vincan is the epitome of grace and aristocratic poise. A true relic of Cyre’s nobility, she carries herself with regal dignity, her every word steeped in eloquence and decorum. She speaks passionately of Cyre’s lost beauty, often waxing poetic about its culture, art, and refinement. Beneath her cultivated exterior, however, Lady Natalia is fiercely proud and unapologetically opinionated. She clings to the traditions of her homeland with an iron will, but her affection for others is genuine, especially for those she considers worthy of her respect.
**Secret**: Lady Natalia was a high-ranking diplomat in Cyre and played a role in negotiating secret treaties during the Last War. One of these treaties betrayed a close ally in exchange for strategic advantage—an act she justified as necessary for Cyre’s survival. The betrayal ultimately led to the deaths of thousands, and while she maintains a facade of innocence, she harbors deep guilt over the decision. Someone connected to the betrayed ally may now be seeking justice or revenge, putting her at risk.
**Overheard Clue:** A fellow passenger murmurs, “Lady Natalia ir’Vincan... wasn’t she involved in Cyre’s court during the war? I heard whispers about... well, less-than-honorable dealings.”
**Conversation Clue:** When discussing Cyre, Natalia grows wistful and says, “I always acted in the best interests of my country. What person wouldn’t? Sacrifices had to be made, though some... still weigh heavily on the heart.”
**Nighttime Clue:** A soft, strained voice from Natalia’s cabin: “I did what I had to. Cyre was everything. They... they would have done the same to us, wouldn’t they?”
**Cabin Clue:** In a drawer near her bed is a creased diplomatic letter sealed with the wax emblem of an ally kingdom. The letter pleads for support during a critical battle, but Natalia’s margin notes read, “Hold back—Cyre must come first.”
**Luggage Clue:** A locked jewelry box contains a medallion bearing the insignia of the betrayed kingdom, alongside a journal with cryptic notes referencing the fateful decision. One entry reads, “The Flame judge me, but Cyre endures because of my actions. The cost was... unavoidable.”

---
### Hilde Wargarden - The Maid
---
_Middle Aged, Female, Human, Short Cut Brown Hair, Short, Stout Build_

**Personality:** Hilde Wargarden appears to be the ideal human lady’s maid: humble, dutiful, and utterly devoted to Lady Natalia. She is soft-spoken and discreet, exuding an air of quiet competence. To others, she seems like a perfectly ordinary servant, a background figure attending to her mistress’s every need. However, beneath her unassuming exterior, Hilde is deeply loyal to Lady Natalia, who is the only person privy to her true changeling identity. Hilde's hidden nature has honed her skills in observation and adaptability, making her an invaluable companion and protector.
**Secret**: Hilde is a changeling who fled from a dangerous past as a member of the Tyrants, a criminal changeling cabal in Sharn. She sought sanctuary with Lady Natalia after abandoning her life of deception, and in return, Natalia has offered her protection and discretion. Hilde now lives in constant fear that her past will catch up with her and that her true nature will be exposed. Her bond with Lady Natalia is genuine, but her ability to maintain her human guise for the world is critical to her survival.
**Overheard Clue:** A passenger quietly remarks, “Lady Natalia’s maid is so peculiar... Almost too perfect, don’t you think? There’s something about her I can’t quite place.”
**Conversation Clue:** When pressed about her life before serving Lady Natalia, Hilde calmly replies, “I’ve been with her ladyship for years. She took me in when I needed a fresh start.” The statement is delivered with conviction, but she avoids elaboration.
**Nighttime Clue:** A faint conversation involving two voices: “You must remain vigilant, Hilde. If anyone discovers—” “They won’t, my lady. I won’t let you down.”
**Cabin Clue:** Under her bed is a worn diary with cryptic entries written in Thieves’ Cant, describing her previous jobs for the Tyrants. The last page reads, “My new face, my new life—no turning back.”
**Luggage Clue:** Hidden inside a seam of her travel cloak is a vial of alchemical ink used for disguises and a small emblem of the Tyrants, with a slash through it, symbolizing her severed ties to the cabal.

---
### Baron Rudolph ir'Wynarn - The Lord
---
_Middle Aged, Male, Human, Collar Length Black Hair with Grey Streaks, Average Height, Average Build_ 

**Personality:** Baron Rudolph ir’Wynarn is a man haunted by the weight of his past. Once a proud and commanding general for Aundair during the Last War, he now carries himself with a subdued, almost somber dignity. He speaks with eloquence and is polite to a fault, though there is an unmistakable melancholy in his voice and eyes. Rudolph’s presence commands respect, but it is clear that his glory days are behind him, and he seems burdened by memories he cannot escape. He rarely speaks of the war and redirects such conversations with graceful tact, though his guilt lingers just beneath the surface. 
**Secret**: While Rudolph’s military exploits are widely known, the darker truth of his wartime actions has tarnished his legacy. Units under his command carried out atrocities against Brelish forces, including the massacre of a defenseless village. Though the blame fell largely on his subordinates, Rudolph knows that his orders, born of desperation and pressure from Aundair’s high command, made those horrors possible. The weight of these actions has shattered his spirit, and he constantly fears judgment from those around him.
**Overheard Clue:** A fellow passenger whispers to another, “That’s Baron Rudolph ir’Wynarn. They say his name still strikes fear in Breland. A war hero, sure—but not everyone agrees on the hero part.”
**Conversation Clue:** When pressed about his wartime service, Rudolph’s voice tightens as he says, “War is not a glorious thing, no matter what the bards sing. It is ugly, cruel, and... it leaves scars no medal can cover.”
**Nighttime Clue:** A muffled cry of anguish from Rudolph’s cabin, followed by his voice in a tortured whisper: “Forgive me... please forgive me.”
**Cabin Clue:** On his bedside table rests a well-worn journal containing entries from his time in the war. One passage reads, “The high command’s orders were clear, but the faces of the dead haunt me still. We obeyed, but at what cost to our souls?”
**Luggage Clue:** Tucked within his belongings is a faded letter from a grieving Brelish widow, condemning him for the destruction of her village. Written on the back in Rudolph’s hand is a single line: “Her words weigh heavier than any sword I’ve carried.”

---  
### Baroness Helena ir'Wynarn - The Trophy
---
_Young, Female, Human, Long Blonde Hair, Average Height, Slim Build_

**Personality:** Lady Helena ir’Wynarn exudes elegance, charm, and sophistication, seamlessly embodying the role of a noblewoman. Younger than her husband by several decades, she is witty and engaging, with a keen intellect that often shines through her carefully chosen words. However, beneath her polished exterior lies a calculating and ambitious mind. Helena is a master of manipulation, able to present herself as empathetic and caring while quietly steering situations to her advantage. She knows how to use her beauty and wit to disarm others, all while carefully guarding her true motives.
**Secret**: Helena’s noble status is a facade; she was born a Brelish peasant whose family suffered horribly under Baron Rudolph’s command during the Last War. Seeking vengeance, she positioned herself to get close to the Baron with the intent of exposing or even killing him. However, upon realizing the Baron was a broken man consumed by guilt, she saw an opportunity to use his power and influence for her own ends. While she harbors some lingering resentment, she is now more focused on advancing her position within the aristocracy, carefully controlling her husband to serve her ambitions.
**Overheard Clue:** A fellow passenger observes, “Lady Helena is quite the enigma, isn’t she? She carries herself like a true noble, but there’s something... I don’t know, unpolished about her accent.”
**Conversation Clue:** When discussing her marriage, Helena smiles faintly and says, “The Baron and I balance each other well. He is... introspective, and I provide the energy. Together, we are stronger than we ever could be apart.” Observers might notice her careful phrasing.
**Nighttime Clue:** Helena’s sharp voice can be heard through the cabin wall: “You’re no general anymore, Rudolph! You’re just a man haunted by his failures—and that is why you need me.”
**Cabin Clue:** Hidden in a drawer is a lockbox containing a sketch of her childhood village, signed by her brother, who perished during the war. A note tucked behind the drawing reads, “Remember why you are here. Finish this.”
**Luggage Clue:** A finely tailored gown has a hidden pocket sewn into its hem containing a dagger inscribed with her family crest. The blade shows little sign of wear, but an investigator might sense its purpose as more symbolic than practical—representing vengeance delayed.

### Colonel Korrun d'Deneith - The Mercenary
---
_Middle Aged, Male, Half Orc, Black and Red Mohawk, Tall, Powerful Build_

**Personality:** Colonel Korrun d’Deneith is a no-nonsense, disciplined soldier who speaks plainly and carries himself with the confidence of someone who has seen countless battles. As a Sentinel Marshal and seasoned mercenary, Korrun is direct and pragmatic, with little patience for pretense or subtlety. Despite his gruff demeanor, he has a strong sense of honor and loyalty, which he values above all else. His half-orc heritage and towering frame make him an imposing figure, and his demeanor suggests he is always prepared for a fight. Beneath the stern exterior, however, lies a man wrestling with conflicting loyalties and personal failures. 
**Secret**: Korrun’s career as a Sentinel Marshal was derailed when his failure to follow orders during a critical mission led to devastating consequences for a Deneith client’s operation. While the House covered up the scandal to protect its reputation, Korrun has carried the guilt ever since. Now working as a freelance mercenary, he has been relegated to minor contracts, far removed from the prestige he once held. Korrun boarded the train hoping to meet a contact who might offer him a chance to redeem himself or at least restore a fraction of his lost honor.
**Overheard Clue:** A fellow passenger observes “Korrun d’Deneith? Haven’t seen him in years. Shame about what happened during the war. He was one of the best.”
**Conversation Clue:** When asked about his work, Korrun gruffly replies, “I’ve been in the field long enough to know that loyalty to the job isn’t always rewarded. These days, I take contracts that suit me—and my conscience.”
**Nighttime Clue:** Korrun can be heard murmuring to himself: “A Deneith Marshal doesn’t hesitate. Doesn’t fail. Except... I did. And they paid the price.”
**Cabin Clue:** An old Sentinel Marshal badge rests on the table, scarred and tarnished. Nearby is a note scrawled with the words, “Redemption is earned, not granted.”
**Luggage Clue:** Tucked into a side pocket of his travel pack is a faded dossier on a failed mission, detailing the casualties and the missing shipment of enchanted arms. Korrun’s name is mentioned in the margins with the phrase, “Command error—proceeding to suppress.”

### Cyrus D'Orien - The Assistant
---
_Old, Male, Gnome, Balding With Grey Hair, Short, Wiry Build_

**Personality:** Cyrus d’Orien is a dedicated and hardworking steward for House Orien, having served on Lightning Rails for decades. An older gnome with a warm demeanor and a penchant for meticulousness, he prides himself on ensuring every passenger is comfortable and well cared for. While generally mild-mannered, Cyrus can be fiercely protective of House Orien’s reputation and the integrity of its services. His years of service have left him knowledgeable about Lightning Rail operations, but they’ve also instilled a weariness that hints at a long-buried burden.
**Secret**: Cyrus’s daughter, a courier for House Orien, was killed during the Last War when the Lightning Rail she was riding was attacked by raiders seeking to steal a critical shipment of military supplies. Though the incident was officially blamed on Brelish forces, Cyrus has uncovered evidence suggesting House Orien leadership knowingly sent his daughter into harm’s way as part of a covert deal with Aundair. Driven by grief and outrage, Cyrus has spent years quietly gathering proof of the betrayal, hoping to one day expose the truth—but doing so could destroy the House he has served loyally all his life.
**Overheard Clue:** Cyrus, speaking to Bouc in a low voice, says, “Sometimes I think they take us for granted, don’t they? They forget who really keeps the rails running.”
**Conversation Clue:** When a passenger praises House Orien, Cyrus responds with a faint smile and says, “Yes, the House does much good. But like any great institution, it has its secrets—some better left undisturbed.”
**Nighttime Clue:** A hushed conversation with himself in his cabin: “It wasn’t the Brelish, I know it wasn’t. She deserved better than to be a pawn in their schemes.”
**Cabin Clue:** n a hidden compartment of his steward’s satchel is a faded family portrait of a young gnome woman in Orien livery, with the name Mariana written on the back. A crumpled note is tucked beside it, bearing fragments of a coded message about the fateful shipment.
**Luggage Clue:** Among Cyrus’s personal effects is a sealed envelope addressed to the House Orien Patriarch, marked “To Be Opened Only Upon My Death.” Inside is a detailed letter accusing senior members of the House of sacrificing Mariana for political gain, along with copies of incriminating documents.

### Lidda d'Jorasco - The Physician
---
_Old, Female, Halfling, Thick Salt and Pepper Hair, Short, Average Build, Has an Odd Tattoo on her Hand_

Lidda d'Jorasco is a dragonmarked healer.  Returning to Karrnath after doing some work in Sharn.  Her dragonmark is readily visible on her hand.
**Personality:** Lidda d’Jorasco is a cheerful and approachable halfling healer who bears the Mark of Healing with pride. Her warm smile and calming presence make her a favorite among the passengers, especially those who are nervous about travel or unwell. She carries herself with the quiet confidence of someone who has saved countless lives, but she also has a tendency to fuss over minor ailments, which can come across as endearing or overly attentive, depending on the recipient. Lidda often deflects personal questions with humor, preferring to focus on others rather than reveal much about herself.
**Secret**: Lidda has a well-earned reputation as a skilled healer, but she harbors a somewhat embarrassing secret: she occasionally uses magical luck manipulation—a rare and subtle aspect of her dragonmark—to influence outcomes when her healing magic or mundane medicine fails. While this ability is not inherently sinister, it is frowned upon by some purists within House Jorasco who view it as interfering with fate. Lidda keeps this practice under wraps to maintain her spotless reputation within the House.
**Overheard Clue:** A passenger remarks, “That Jorasco healer is a miracle worker! Though I did hear someone say her methods aren’t exactly... conventional.”
**Conversation Clue:** When discussing her work, Lidda says with a small, cryptic smile, “Sometimes, the best healers don’t just treat the body. A little luck can work wonders, wouldn’t you agree?”
**Nighttime Clue:** Soft muttering can be heard from Lidda’s cabin: “Come on, Lidda, you can’t keep doing this... What if someone finds out? They wouldn’t understand...”
**Cabin Clue:** A journal on her bedside table contains detailed healing notes but also occasional cryptic symbols related to luck manipulation, written in shorthand. A more thorough reader might spot entries such as, “Failed again. Luck shifted at the last moment—thank the Host for small blessings.”
**Luggage Clue:** Among her healer’s kit is a small pouch of polished stones etched with runes of luck and fortune, items not commonly associated with Jorasco healing practices.

### Exagora - The Guard
---
_Middle Aged, Female, Tiefling, Short Black Hair with Ebony Rams Horns, Average Height and Build_

**Personality:** Exagora is a tiefling with a sharp tongue and a sardonic wit, the kind of person who deflects probing questions with humor or outright hostility. She has the air of someone who’s always watching, always analyzing. Though she often seems detached or disinterested, she has a strong moral compass beneath her rough exterior. She values justice, but her time in Sharn’s town guard left her disillusioned with institutions and authority. Now, Exagora travels to escape her past, carrying with her the weight of failures she’d rather not discuss.
**Secret**: Exagora’s resignation from the Sharn city guard wasn’t voluntary. She was dismissed after a botched investigation that resulted in a prominent noble’s death. Though she wasn’t directly responsible, her superiors made her the scapegoat to avoid political fallout. This event left her bitter and unmoored, prompting her to leave Sharn and take up a nomadic lifestyle. She boards the Lightning Rail hoping to find some form of redemption or purpose, though she isn’t sure what that might be.
**Overheard Clue:** A passenger remarks after seeing Exagora’s uniform-like jacket: “She looks like a guard. Or used to be, anyway. Wonder why she left the force?”
**Conversation Clue:** When asked about her past, Exagora says curtly, “Sharn’s a big city. People get lost there—sometimes permanently. The guard? Let’s just say it wasn’t what I thought it’d be.”
**Nighttime Clue:** Muffled words come from her cabin: “I didn’t pull the trigger, damn it! But it didn’t matter, did it?”
**Cabin Clue:** A crumpled and torn letter from Sharn’s city guard lies in a drawer. It’s an official notice of dismissal, stating, “This decision is final. We cannot risk further exposure of the incident.”
**Luggage Clue:** A battered notebook contains sketches and notes about the noble whose death she was blamed for, alongside scribbled musings like, “Could I have stopped it? Should I have done more?”

## The Outline
The adventure will take place in three acts, most of which will have to be done in an ad hoc manner.  In the first act the party will board the train, meet the other passengers and become familiar with the other players.  The first act ends with them going to bed on the first night in their berths.  During the night Professor House is murdered.  The party is woken early (but after eight hours) by the train coming to a stop.  Cyrus will come by to alert the party that there has been a problem with the line and that they will be delayed for a little bit.  Shortly thereafter Bouc will come to the party and summon them to the First Class car, ordering others to stay in their berths for the time being.  Bouc will reveal the murder to the party, along with Lidda d'Jorasco.   This act will mostly consist of the party investigating the murders.  In the final act the party will confront the murderer and fight him or her to save their ally.

The important part of the setup is that there is no one set murderer.  Everyone has a secret to hide, and depending on what the players learn they might reasonably suspect anyone on board.  Once the players seem to be focusing in on one or two suspects, plant the following clues on the one they seem to think least likely:

- **An Overheard Conversation:** "Yes, it is done.  I do not know why I was tasked with this.  But it was done.  There are problems.  I need an exit."
- **Casual Conversation:** "No.  I am not one for those great faiths.  There are powers beyond the gods, you know.  I look to them."
- **Overheard Clue:** Players might hear chanting in another language.  Anyone who can understand the language recognize it as some kind of ritual that invokes "Dal Quor"
- **Cabin Clue:** A journal which consists of highly detailed notes involving celestial movement as well as other things the party doesn't quite understand.  The phrase "all dreams converge at the end" seems to appear in multiple places
- **Luggage Clue:** A vial of a thick, iridescent liquid is found in the luggage.  Lidda d'Jorasco and Bouc d'Orien can identify it as "Dreamlilly Extract" - a potent narcotic designed to induce a dream-filled slumber.  This can also be done with a suitable medicine or nature check.
- **Other Clue**: If players have a way to see invisible objects and they look at the murderer they will see an invisible ring on their finger.  A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check will reveal that the ring must be a ring of mind shielding, which protects them from mind reading/truth telling magic (including Zone of Truth - they simply auto-save on that).  If questioned about it they will feign ignorance (if they question the fact that they auto-save against Zone of Truth they will shrug, saying they do not know how such magic works)

Additionally the party will find a Keeper's Fang in the possession of the most focused on suspect.  This was planted by the murderer to hide his involvement and through suspicion on others, but it was not perfect - the blade is not bloody and the dragonshard within is empty - Lidda d'Jorasco is unable to restore Professor House's soul from within.

### Act I - Setting the Board
#### Boarding
The first opportunity the players have to interact with the other passengers (who will eventually become suspects) is at boarding.  A porter will greet them and offer to take their luggage (they presumably have none, but Professor House does) and help them on board.  As they are boarding they will have the following encounter:

> As you board the carriage you get a strange look from one of the uniformed railway staff.  **"Professor House?"** he asks your new ally
>
> Rather pleased at being recognized the professor nods in response.  **"It's good to see you again sir..."** the young steward says **"...you, probably don't remember me.  I am Bouc d'Orien.  I took your class on the socio-economic impacts of the Last War on the Dragonmarked Houses a year ago. "**
>
>The professor pauses for a moment then nods.  **"Yes..."** he says, somewhat confidently **"...yes I remember you.  Not your face, sorry - I am terrible with faces.  But your name I remember.  You wrote a piece about house House Orien - your house, I'll note - could profit from the failure and breakup of House Cannith.  It provided some interesting perspective."**
>
> Bouc d'Orien stares for a moment, surprised that the professor remember his work.  **"I..."** he starts hesitantly **"...yes, I did write that.  I'm surprised you remember it.  Thank you."**  He seems genuinely thankful that the professor actually remember his work.  **"You know the work I did at Morgave got me this job..."** he says proudly **"...I know a steward isn't much, but it's a start."**  He beams for a second before he remembers his job.  **"Oh.  Speaking of - your tickets please?"**  He examines the tickets and smiles.  **"Professor, we have an open first class berth.  I will assign you to it - with my thanks.  If you will all follow me I will take you all to your berths."**

As boarding is kind of an open area, allow them all to make DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) checks.  For every success allow them to hear one 'Overheard Clue' determined at random.

#### Socializing
Players will have an opportunity early in the trip to visit the social car and enjoy a beverage with the other second and first class passengers.  To determine who is in the social car roll 1d11 five times and use the results to determine who is present (double mean there is one fewer passenger present, additionally the party can always talk to Bouc or Cyrus).  Each individual player can only have a conversation with one person (although they may double up if they please).  Allow them to make roles for various social skills (depending on their attitude) to get a few more hints about the personalities and secrets of the NPCs.

#### Dining
Another opportunity to converse with the NPCs will occur a little later during the dinner service.  Same rules apply - one conversation - however every NPC (except Bouc and Cyrus, who are busy preparing berths for the night) are present.

#### Nightime
The party presumably rests after dinner.  Allow them to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check (with advantage, if they do not need to sleep for some reason and allow them to catch a randomly determined nighttime clue if they succeed.

### Act II - Murder Investigation
#### An Unexpected Delay
> Sometime during the night - late enough that you all got a full eight hours sleep, but early enough to make sure only the first rays of the sun are starting to bathe the land in daylight - you are awakened by the train suddenly coming to a lurching stop.  Before you can get up you hear Cyrus d'Orien walking down the corridor.  **"Seems like we are having a problem with the line folks.  Nothing serious, but please stay in your berths for the time being so our crew can move quickly and try and get this problem resolved.  I will be around with some tea and coffee shortly."**
>
> A few minutes later you hear Bouc making the same announcement, including an additional note that Cyrus will have the tea service first, followed shortly by coffee.  However when Bouc reaches the party's berths he knocks on the door and asks to be allowed to enter.  When you open the door he simply says **"Follow me please..."**.  Shortly thereafter the party, along with Lidda d'Jorasco, arrive at the cabin of Professor House, where Bouc and Cyrus reveal (quietly) that the professor has been murdered sometime during the night.
>
> Lidda, a Jorasco Healer, steps forward.  **"Allow me..."** she says, touching the odd tattoo on her left hand.  It glows, and she reaches out towards the body, but nothing happens.  **"Curious..."** she says **"...his soul is missing.  I cannot call it back to his body."**  She turns to the party **"You were his friends, correct?  May I inspect his body?"**

_Assuming the players do not object..._

>Lidda reaches forward, removing Professor House's night shirt and revealing several large and deep wounds across his torso.  Even from where you are standing you can see they are not mere wounds - a type of corruption seems to radiate outwards from them, giving his flesh an ashen, cracked appearance  **"As I thought..."** she says **"...this was no random attack.  This man was assassinated.  They used a specific kind of weapon commonly called a Keeper's Fang - I encountered a great many similar victims with similar wounds during the Great War.  The nature of the blade prevents healers from restoring life to the victim.  Common belief is that the blades send the soul of the victim to the Keeper - where it is devoured - but that is a myth.  It uses a dragonshard to trap the soul of the victim."**  She sighs slightly **"A terrible, vicious weapon used exclusively by killers.  But the upside is if you find it I can have him back on his feet quickly.  If we destroy the blade where his soul is imprisoned he and his body should be restored."**

#### The Investigation
The players can now go into investigation mode.  Bouc will advise them that they must act both quickly and discretely - when the relief train arrives House Orien will most certainly take over the investigation (and any assassin worth his salt will have paid of someone in House Orien to ensure he avoids capture), and dealing with folks - especially those in first class - might require a bit of care and diplomacy.  Both Bouc and Lidda will make themselves available helping smooth things where it needs to be smooth, and lore dropping for the world of Eberron where needed.

The trick is that anyone could be the murderer.  As the party gradually comes to suspect one or two passengers, seed them with clues that seem to point them in that direction.  

### Act III
#### The Final Confrontation
When the party finally reveals who they believe is the murderer they will find they are correct, but perhaps the murderer has one final trick to play.  A servant of Dal Quor, the creature manifests itself as a Dreaming Dark Assassin (Mind Flayer Psion) and five Dreaming Dark Night Terrors (Chasme-ish) for the party to fight (on the train with civilians present)
