# Caught by Strahd
At the conclusion of their adventure into the Mournlands the party will have had the opportunity to gain one of the secrets needed to stabilize the cosmos.  Of course that was the easy one - the one Mordenkainen outlined in his thesis about the Tome of True Balance.

Fortunately the automata that are part of Mordenkainen's Bastion have been hard at work cataloguing data while the party is away (N-C4R-T4).  They have found another snippet of Mordenkainen's writings which leads them to the next step...

> The Domains of Dread.
>  
>  An interesting demiplane that seems to be co-terminus with every realm I have encountered in all the cosmos.  That seems interesting, but it does not seem stable enough - after all, the Orrey of the Planes allows me to travel to any realm I choose.  In some ways it too touches all other realms.  And I am hardly a master of planar travel.
>  
>  But there is something there I think.  Not the demiplane itself.  But the forces that style themselves its rulers.  I had the misfortune to be trapped in one not long ago.  One overseen by a petty tyrant named Strahd who styled himself some kind of god-king.  But I came to learn he was no god.  In a temple in that realm there was knowledge of things greater than Strahd.  Creatures that were keeping that monster a prisoner even as they granted him dominion over Barovia.  The so-called 'Dark Powers'.  
>  
>  I wish I had learned more then, but my mind was focused on my own escape. With the assistance of an odious dwarf who thought himself a holy man, but was clearly a sorcerer of some sort, a tabaxi and the reborn focus of Strahd's 'affection' we defeated Strahd - for a time at least. I do not relish the idea of going back there.  I could easily be trapped again.  
>  
>  But perhaps I do not need to.  The Domains of Dread hold many prisoners who think themselves petty tyrants.  And there is one amongst them who hates Vecna above all else.  Kas the Betrayer.  Perhaps I should should make for Tovag, and find myself an ally - even if I will have to be on my guard with him.

Presumably they'll return to the Orrey and try and make their way to Tovag.  However as they do...

> You step into the portal formed by the Orrey, but instead of stepping out into the forested realm you had expected you step into inky blackness.
> 
> The space, if it can be called that - for it is more like an absence of space - is filled with countless voices that you cannot make out, but you can feel in your bones.  In your soul.  They scream at you.  They call you intruders.  Say you are working for the fugitive.  That you are here to free another prisoner.  You would fall to your knees in pain from the cacophony - if you had knees.  Like the voices you seem to only exist here as a voice.  A thought.
> 
> And then once voice silences all.  "You know, my masters, that I am always happy to take interesting playthings into my realm.  Send them to me, so they do not disturb you any further..."
>
> The void fades, and you wake up around the embers of a campfire as dawn is approaching.  But something inside of you feels off... the dawn is dull, grey.  Swallowed by clouds.  And you are somewhere you did not expect to be...

## Outline
One of the Demiplanes of Dread, Barovia is subject to the following rules:
* Supernatural mists surround Barovia and keep its prisoners imprisoned.  Anyone trying to leave Barovia gets lost in the mists and winds up back where they started - no exceptions (Strahd does frequently allow the Vistani to leave - but that is only by his parole, something he will not offer the players).
*  Strahd, being a vampire, is not terribly interested in having the sun shining in his realm.  As such, heavy cloud almost always obscures the sun, bathing the world in dim light that does not impact creatures who are affected by the sun.  Vampires still tend to be nocturnal though (easier hunting) and magic that causes sunlight does function as normal.
* Vistani is another name for Tabaxi in Barovia

Additionally, some magic functions differently:
* Any spell that would allow someone to escape the domain simply fails (after all, what good is a jail that can be escape with a plane shift).  This includes spells like banishment.  Simply put - what is in Barovia stays in Barovia unless Strahd or the Dark Powers get involved.
* Summoning spells fail for similar reasons, although spells that call familiars or companions do function - they simply call on local spirits and energies (as opposed to summoning a fire elemental from the elemental planes or a planetar from Celestia).
* Spells that utilize extra-dimensional spaces do function, but effects that would tear a hole in reality (putting a portable hole in a bag of holding for example) cause the same catastrophic effects, but do not create a hole in reality leading to the astral plane)
* Basically - there's no quick and easy escapes from the Domains of Dread.  If there was some of the characters imprisoned there (which once included Vecna) would easily escape. 
* Any magic that allows communications with entities on other planes is usable, with the proviso that Strahd can always (and does always) listen in on such communication, or if he wishes, he can redirect the call to himself and respond as if he were the entity being contacted.

## The Story as Planned
There is no intention for the players to play out the 'Curse of Strahd' as (a) the party are high enough level to trivialize most of the encounters and (b) the party are already in another adventure.  

Rather, upon awakening in the Svalich Woods and heading west (heading east brings them to the Gates of Barovia and the mists that keep prisoners in their cell) the party should know enough to make for the Amber Temple, to learn of their jailers (something they need to do to save the cosmos) and maybe find a means of escape.

The focus is going to be placed upon the locations in Barovia the players are likely to visit in the pursuit of this goal.  If they go off script you may have to improvise, but the ideal path will take the party through the following:

Barovia -> Tser Pool Encampment -> Old Bonegrinder -> Vallaki -> Tsolenka Pass -> The Amber Temple 

It is worth noting that any of these except the Tsolenka Pass and the Amber Temple can be skipped.

## Food and Drink in Barovia
### Foods in Barovia
#### Morgantha's Dream Pies
Eating one of Morgantha's pies has one of the following effects:
* If eaten as a bonus action in combat you may add 1d4 to any attack roll or saving throw in the next minute.
* If eaten outside of combat it heals 2d4+2 hp
* If eaten before a long rest, you gain two extra hit dice to use during the next day.

However they are addictive.  The morning after you eat one roll a DC 10+2*(Total Number of Pies Eaten Lifetime) Constitution Save.  If they fail they become first level addicts.  Addicts have debuffs added to their character that make them weaker.  They can remedy this by eating a pie (from which they gain no other benefits - however eating subsequent pies does give them one of the benefits) or they can suffer through the addiction.  If they consume even a single pie during the day they run the risk of getting further addicted (make a new save the following morning).  If they go 24 hours without eating a pie the next morning they can make a save to drop down one level on the addiction chart.  *LPC stands for lifetime pie consumption - how many pies they have eaten total.  Track this!*

| Level | Impact | Con Save Better | Con Save Worse |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| First | +1 Exhaustion |  10+2x(LPC) | 12+2x(LPC) | 
| Second | +2 Exhaustion | 12+2x(LPC) | 14+2x(LPC) |
| Third | +3 Exhaustion | 14+2x(LPC) | -- |

### Drink in Barovia
Almost all alcohol in Barovia is wine or wine-based, and almost all wine is made by the Martikov family (some is brought in by Vistani traders).  A description of the Martikov family wines is below:

#### Grapesmash
Grapesmash is the lowest grade of Martikov wine.  It is a red wine, made from grapes unfit for any other purpose.  It is, however, widely available.  Grapesmash wines tend to be tannin heavy and have a bitter, metallic aftertaste.  The Martikov's sell three types of Grapesmash wines - Grapesmash #3, which is purely made from Grapesmash grapes (and thus has the most pronounced Grapesmash 'flavour') and Grapesmash #2 & #1 - each of which uses progressively more of the Martikov's other grapes to dull the harsh edge of Grapesmash.
 
#### Dragoncrush
Dragoncrush is a red varietal from the Martikov winery.  They make two varieties of this varietal - Red Dragoncrush and Black Dragoncrush - as well as a brandy which is made from Red Dragoncrush called Dragon's Breath.  Red Dragoncrush uses dried grapes and is aged in oak barrels, giving it a spicy, cinnamony flavour.  Black Dragoncrush mixes fresh Dragoncrush grapes with Winterstomp grapes to give it a fresh, crisp flavour.  Dragon's Breath Brandy leans into the natural flavours of Red Dragoncrush, and is very spicy.  

#### Winterstomp
Winterstomp is a white varietal from the Martikov winery.  They are mainly used to balance the flavours of the Martikov Red varietals, as the grapes themselves are almost too acidic on their own.  The Martikov's do make a sparkling Winterstomp wine that is somewhat refreshing (if very acidic).
