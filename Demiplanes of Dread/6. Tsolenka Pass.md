### Tsolenka Pass
*Note: Although it is daylight here, it is dim light and all vision is capped at 60 ft due to weather conditions*

#### Approach
> The shelf of rock on which the mountain road clings to grows narrow.  To your left, the icy cliffs rise sharply towards dark, rolling clouds.  To your right the ground falls away into a sea of fog.  Ahead, through the wind and snow, you see a high wall of black stone lined with spikes and topped by statues of demonic, four armed, horned figures.  Set in the centre of this wall is a closed iron portcullis, behind which burns a curtain of green flame.
>
> Emerging from the flickering wall of green flames that dances like spectral fire across the gate, a figure steps forward with the grace of a shadow and the poise of a king. The flames part for him, curling back like servants bowing before their master, casting eerie light across his pale, statuesque face. His black cloak flutters in the chill mountain wind, edges singed with ember-glow, but untouched by the flame itself.
>
>His eyes—two smoldering coals of crimson—scan the mountain pass with ancient boredom and predatory interest. Every movement he makes is deliberate, fluid, and terrifyingly calm, as though the world itself bends politely to his stride. The golden embroidery on his dark vest catches the flame’s glow, glinting like fresh blood on polished steel. You know this figure - both from his appearance when you were pulled into this cursed land, and by his reputation here in Barovia - this is Count Strahd von Zarovich, Lord of Barovia.
>
>Behind him, the flames resume their chaotic dance—but he stands still, a figure of cold command framed in ghostly green light, the stormy sky rolling behind him. No living thing dares breathe too loud. Strahd has arrived.
>
> "You know, you will not find what you seek in this place.  I will not pretend to know much about your purpose and your reasons, but I know you seek a way to walk free from this prison.  I have come to tell you that you will not find it here."
>
> "I came here, eons ago, in search of something similar.  I heard whispers of shadowed secrets and forbidden knowledge.  The ancients, it was said, knew what I could not.  Do you know what I found?"
> 
> "Nothing.  Empty promises and the shell of something greater."
> 
> "Do yourselves a favour.  Leave this path.  Come and join me in Castle Ravenloft.  You are prisoners here, it is true, but you need not make Barovia a prison.  You are not the usual sort who wander into my domain.  You are powerful.  Formidable.  Come - join me.  Help me regain my Katarina.  That feat and that feat alone will break the endless cycle of this land, and free all of us!"

Strahd will happily converse with his players and discuss anything and everything with them.  He is genuine with his invitation, and his motives are clear - high level adventurers like the party would be useful to him.  If they attack him they will find that Strahd's form here is just an image.  And if they choose to continue to seek the Amber Temple...

> "As you wish.  I am not so foolish as to try to stop the likes of you.  Neither will I help you though.  Not any longer.  Barovia is a dangerous land, and while I have kept the dangers at bay heretofore, I will do so no longer.  Consider this a warning - if you travel beyond this gate, you do so on your own.

With that the image of Strahd will fade, and players will be faced with the gate of flames. 

#### T1. Gatehouse Portcullis
The gate here is old and is rusted open here - the way is now barred with magical green flame instead of metal.

#### T2. Demon Statues
These statues are actually guardians of the gate.  If the players attack the statues, pass through (or over, or under, or around) the gate, they will become two glabrezu and attack the players.

#### T3. Curtain of Green Flame
The archway is filled with a curtain of green flame.  Any creature that starts its turn in the green flame and any creature that enters the curtain for takes 6d10 fire damage.  A successful casting of dispel magic (DC 16) suppresses the curtain, as does any anti-magic field.

#### T4. Guard Tower, Bottom Floor
The door to this area is made of iron bound wood and has been barred from the inside.  A DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check is required to open it.  

> A cold hearth stands across from the door, the wind howling down the its chimney.  A stone staircase lines the south wall.  Three windows look out over ai ea of endless fog.

The stairs climb to T5.

#### T5.  Guard Tower, Upper Floor
> The upper level of this tower is an icebox, with windows set into almost every wall, letting the wind howl through mercilessly.  A rusted iron ladder bolted to the floor and ceiling leads up to a wooden trapdoor.  Mounted above the cold stone hearth is a dire wolf's head - the wind coming down the chimney howls in the stead of it's now stolen voice.

The ladder leads up to T6

#### T6. Guard Tower, Rooftop
>Ten foot tall, gold plated statues stand atop the battlements, facing outward.  Each one depicts a human knight, holding a lance.  The cold wind stirs the snow, under which you count five human skeletons clad in rusty chain mail.

The roof here is 40 ft above the Tsolenka Pass and 50 ft above the mist shrouded valley below.  A squeaky wooden trapdoor in the floor leads to T5 below.  The skeletons are the remains of the five guards who last held this post long ago.  If characters search the remains they will find nothing useful - just bits of tattered cloth, rotted and broken longbows and rusty weapons and mail but they will disturb the souls of the dead, summoning the feuereis (who start in ice form) - the frozen souls of the former guards of this place.

#### Nameless Area
After the players leave the guard tower but before they reach the bridge the following occurs...

> As you move along the narrow path here you begin to hear a rumbling in the mountains to your left.  It gets closer and close - you become aware that whatever is coming must be massive.  And then you see it - this massive beast rumbling through the mists, it's feet causing the earth to rumble with every step.  Brown shaggy hair, blood red eyes and crimson stained tusks bear down upon you.

#### T7. Western Arch
> The snowy pass come to a gorge spanned by a stone bridge.  At each end of the bridge is a thirty foot tall, thirty foot wide stone arch.  Atop each are two statues of armoured knights on horseback with lances, charging towards one another.  The wind bites and howls like wolves running down the gorge.

#### T8. Stone Bridge
> The low walls that enclose the stone bridge have fallen away in a couple places, but the bridge itself appears intact.

If Sangzor does a lot of damage to the party then skip this encounter.  Otherwise....

> As you get about halfway across the bridge you hear a guttural, angry shriek out into the mists, and the soft, leathery beating of wings upon the winds....

A young red shadow dragon begins to attack the party on the bridge.  He will do flybys, using the mists and his speed (and his ability to hide in shadows) to appear from the mists, swoop down, grapple a character, and then soar once more into the air - trying to pick them off one by one.

#### T9. Eastern Arch
> One of the statues atop this arch has crumbled, leaving only the horse's hindquarters intact.
