# Caught by Strahd
## Setup
At the conclusion of their adventure into the Mournlands the party will have had the opportunity to gain one of the secrets needed to stabilize the cosmos.  Of course that was the easy one - the one Mordenkainen outlined in his thesis about the Tome of True Balance.

Fortunately the automata that are part of Mordenkainen's Bastion have been hard at work cataloguing data while the party is away (N-C4R-T4).  They have found another snippet of Mordenkainen's writings which leads them to the next step...

> The Domains of Dread.
>  
>  An interesting demiplane that seems to be co-terminus with every realm I have encountered in all the cosmos.  That seems interesting, but it does not seem stable enough - after all, the Orrey of the Planes allows me to travel to any realm I choose.  In some ways it too touches all other realms.  And I am hardly a master of planar travel.
>  
>  But there is something there I think.  Not the demiplane itself.  But the forces that style themselves its rulers.  I had the misfortune to be trapped in one not long ago.  One overseen by a petty tyrant named Strahd who styled himself some kind of god-king.  But I came to learn he was no god.  In a temple in that realm there was knowledge of things greater than Strahd.  Creatures that were keeping that monster a prisoner even as they granted him dominion over Barovia.  The so-called 'Dark Powers'.  
>  
>  I wish I had learned more then, but my mind was focused on my own escape. With the assistance of an odious dwarf who thought himself a holy man, but was clearly a sorcerer of some sort, a tabaxi and the reborn focus of Strahd's 'affection' we defeated Strahd - for a time at least. I do not relish the idea of going back there.  I could easily be trapped again.  
>  
>  But perhaps I do not need to.  The Domains of Dread hold many prisoners who think themselves petty tyrants.  And there is one amongst them who hates Vecna above all else.  Kas the Betrayer.  Perhaps I should should make for Tovag, and find myself an ally - even if I will have to be on my guard with him.

Presumably they'll return to the Orrey and try and make their way to Tovag.  However as they do...

> You step into the portal formed by the Orrey, but instead of stepping out into the forested realm you had expected you step into inky blackness.
> 
> The space, if it can be called that - for it is more like an absence of space - is filled with countless voices that you cannot make out, but you can feel in your bones.  In your soul.  They scream at you.  They call you intruders.  Say you are working for the fugitive.  That you are here to free another prisoner.  You would fall to your knees in pain from the cacophony - if you had knees.  Like the voices you seem to only exist here as a voice.  A thought.
> 
> And then once voice silences all.  "You know, my masters, that I am always happy to take interesting playthings into my realm.  Send them to me, so they do not disturb you any further..."
>
> The void fades, and you wake up around the embers of a campfire as dawn is approaching.  But something inside of you feels off... the dawn is dull, grey.  Swallowed by clouds.  And you are somewhere you did not expect to be...

## Barovia
##### Notes of Barovia
One of the Demiplanes of Dread, Barovia is subject to the following rules:
* Supernatural mists surround Barovia and keep its prisoners imprisoned.  Anyone trying to leave Barovia gets lost in the mists and winds up back where they started - no exceptions (Strahd does frequently allow the Vistani to leave - but that is only by his parole, something he will not offer the players).
*  Strahd, being a vampire, is not terribly interested in having the sun shining in his realm.  As such, heavy cloud almost always obscures the sun, bathing the world in dim light that does not impact creatures who are affected by the sun.  Vampires still tend to be nocturnal though (easier hunting) and magic that causes sunlight does function as normal.
* Vistani is another name for Tabaxi in Barovia

Additionally, some magic functions differently:
* Any spell that would allow someone to escape the domain simply fails (after all, what good is a jail that can be escape with a plane shift).  This includes spells like banishment.  Simply put - what is in Barovia stays in Barovia unless Strahd or the Dark Powers get involved.
* Summoning spells fail for similar reasons, although spells that call familiars or companions do function - they simply call on local spirits and energies (as opposed to summoning a fire elemental from the elemental planes or a planetar from Celestia).
* Spells that utilize extra-dimensional spaces do function, but effects that would tear a hole in reality (putting a portable hole in a bag of holding for example) cause the same catastrophic effects, but do not create a hole in reality leading to the astral plane)
* Basically - there's no quick and easy escapes from the Domains of Dread.  If there was some of the characters imprisoned there (which once included Vecna) would easily escape. 
* Any magic that allows communications with entities on other planes is usable, with the proviso that Strahd can always (and does always) listen in on such communication, or if he wishes, he can redirect the call to himself and respond as if he were the entity being contacted.

### The Story as Planned
There is no intention for the players to play out the 'Curse of Strahd' as (a) the party are high enough level to trivialize most of the encounters and (b) the party are already in another adventure.  

Rather, upon awakening in the Svalich Woods and heading west (heading east brings them to the Gates of Barovia and the mists that keep prisoners in their cell) the party should know enough to make for the Amber Temple, to learn of their jailers (something they need to do to save the cosmos) and maybe find a means of escape.

The focus is going to be placed upon the locations in Barovia the players are likely to visit in the pursuit of this goal.  If they go off script you may have to improvise...









### Tsolenka Pass
*Note: Although it is daylight here, it is dim light and all vision is capped at 60 ft due to weather conditions*

#### Approach
> The shelf of rock on which the mountain road clings to grows narrow.  To your left, the icy cliffs rise sharply towards dark, rolling clouds.  To your right the ground falls away into a sea of fog.  Ahead, through the wind and snow, you see a high wall of black stone lined with spikes and topped by statues of demonic, four armed, horned figures.  Set in the centre of this wall is a closed iron portcullis, behind which burns a curtain of green flame.
>
> Emerging from the flickering wall of green flames that dances like spectral fire across the gate, a figure steps forward with the grace of a shadow and the poise of a king. The flames part for him, curling back like servants bowing before their master, casting eerie light across his pale, statuesque face. His black cloak flutters in the chill mountain wind, edges singed with ember-glow, but untouched by the flame itself.
>
>His eyes—two smoldering coals of crimson—scan the mountain pass with ancient boredom and predatory interest. Every movement he makes is deliberate, fluid, and terrifyingly calm, as though the world itself bends politely to his stride. The golden embroidery on his dark vest catches the flame’s glow, glinting like fresh blood on polished steel. You know this figure - both from his appearance when you were pulled into this cursed land, and by his reputation here in Barovia - this is Count Strahd von Zarovich, Lord of Barovia.
>
>Behind him, the flames resume their chaotic dance—but he stands still, a figure of cold command framed in ghostly green light, the stormy sky rolling behind him. No living thing dares breathe too loud. Strahd has arrived.
>
> "You know, you will not find what you seek in this place.  I will not pretend to know much about your purpose and your reasons, but I know you seek a way to walk free from this prison.  I have come to tell you that you will not find it here."
>
> "I came here, eons ago, in search of something similar.  I heard whispers of shadowed secrets and forbidden knowledge.  The ancients, it was said, knew what I could not.  Do you know what I found?"
> 
> "Nothing.  Empty promises and the shell of something greater."
> 
> "Do yourselves a favour.  Leave this path.  Come and join me in Castle Ravenloft.  You are prisoners here, it is true, but you need not make Barovia a prison.  You are not the usual sort who wander into my domain.  You are powerful.  Formidable.  Come - join me.  Help me regain my Katarina.  That feat and that feat alone will break the endless cycle of this land, and free all of us!"

Strahd will happily converse with his players and discuss anything and everything with them.  He is genuine with his invitation, and his motives are clear - high level adventurers like the party would be useful to him.  If they attack him they will find that Strahd's form here is just an image.  And if they choose to continue to seek the Amber Temple...

> "As you wish.  I am not so foolish as to try to stop the likes of you.  Neither will I help you though.  Not any longer.  Barovia is a dangerous land, and while I have kept the dangers at bay heretofore, I will do so no longer.  Consider this a warning - if you travel beyond this gate, you do so on your own.

With that the image of Strahd will fade, and players will be faced with the gate of flames. 

#### T1. Gatehouse Portcullis
The gate here is old and is rusted open here - the way is now barred with magical green flame instead of metal.

#### T2. Demon Statues
These statues are actually guardians of the gate.  If the players attack the statues, pass through (or over, or under, or around) the gate, they will become two glabrezu and attack the players.

#### T3. Curtain of Green Flame
The archway is filled with a curtain of green flame.  Any creature that starts its turn in the green flame and any creature that enters the curtain for takes 6d10 fire damage.  A successful casting of dispel magic (DC 16) suppresses the curtain, as does any anti-magic field.

#### T4. Guard Tower, Bottom Floor
The door to this area is made of iron bound wood and has been barred from the inside.  A DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check is required to open it.  

> A cold hearth stands across from the door, the wind howling down the its chimney.  A stone staircase lines the south wall.  Three windows look out over ai ea of endless fog.

The stairs climb to T5.

#### T5.  Guard Tower, Upper Floor
> The upper level of this tower is an icebox, with windows set into almost every wall, letting the wind howl through mercilessly.  A rusted iron ladder bolted to the floor and ceiling leads up to a wooden trapdoor.  Mounted above the cold stone hearth is a dire wolf's head - the wind coming down the chimney howls in the stead of it's now stolen voice.

The ladder leads up to T6

#### T6. Guard Tower, Rooftop
>Ten foot tall, gold plated statues stand atop the battlements, facing outward.  Each one depicts a human knight, holding a lance.  The cold wind stirs the snow, under which you count five human skeletons clad in rusty chain mail.

The roof here is 40 ft above the Tsolenka Pass and 50 ft above the mist shrouded valley below.  A squeaky wooden trapdoor in the floor leads to T5 below.  The skeletons are the remains of the five guards who last held this post long ago.  If characters search the remains they will find nothing useful - just bits of tattered cloth, rotted and broken longbows and rusty weapons and mail but they will disturb the souls of the dead, summoning the feuereis (who start in ice form) - the frozen souls of the former guards of this place.

#### Nameless Area
After the players leave the guard tower but before they reach the bridge the following occurs...

> As you move along the narrow path here you begin to hear a rumbling in the mountains to your left.  It gets closer and close - you become aware that whatever is coming must be massive.  And then you see it - this massive beast rumbling through the mists, it's feet causing the earth to rumble with every step.  Brown shaggy hair, blood red eyes and crimson stained tusks bear down upon you.

#### T7. Western Arch
> The snowy pass come to a gorge spanned by a stone bridge.  At each end of the bridge is a thirty foot tall, thirty foot wide stone arch.  Atop each are two statues of armoured knights on horseback with lances, charging towards one another.  The wind bites and howls like wolves running down the gorge.

#### T8. Stone Bridge
> The low walls that enclose the stone bridge have fallen away in a couple places, but the bridge itself appears intact.

If Sangzor does a lot of damage to the party then skip this encounter.  Otherwise....

> As you get about halfway across the bridge you hear a guttural, angry shriek out into the mists, and the soft, leathery beating of wings upon the winds....

A young red shadow dragon begins to attack the party on the bridge.  He will do flybys, using the mists and his speed (and his ability to hide in shadows) to appear from the mists, swoop down, grapple a character, and then soar once more into the air - trying to pick them off one by one.

#### T9. Eastern Arch
> One of the statues atop this arch has crumbled, leaving only the horse's hindquarters intact.  

### The Amber Temple
> As you wind your way through the snow-choked mountain path, the cold intensifies - not just in temperature, but in presence. The wind here doesn't whistle or howl; it whispers, low and guttural, threading through the stones like the breath of something ancient.
>
> And then you see it.
>
> Carved directly into the mountainside, a black shape looms from the cliff face: the Amber Temple. A staircase of cracked stone leads down into a wide courtyard before its entrance—yet the structure beyond seems wrong against the pale white snow. Where the sun strikes the mountains, the temple drinks in the light and offers nothing back. Its massive amber columns, once gilded by age and grandeur, now seem to bleed shadow. Not even the reflected gleam of snow touches its surface.
> 
> For those with dark vision, the shadows still cling—thicker than they should be, heavier somehow, as if the darkness itself resents being seen. Edges blur. Shapes shift at the corners of your vision. The great bronze doors ahead are shut tight, flanked by still guardian statues half-buried in drifting snow, their eyes dark hollows that seem to follow your approach.
> 
> The very air near the temple feels different - denser - like the atmosphere just before a storm, or a breath held far too long. Something waits inside.
>
>And it knows you're coming.

#### What's Really Going On Here
**Nature of the Amber Temple:** The Amber Temple in Barovia is the physical manifestation of the metaphysical concept - the essence of the Demiplanes of Dread themselves.  In truth there is an equivalent of the Amber Temple in every one of the domains of Ravenloft - one for every Dread Lord, built upon a foundation of the fears, regrets, obsessions and the nature of their prison made manifest.  

**Nature of the Dark Powers:** The Dark Powers are not gods - not truly.  They are ideas with so much metaphysical weight that they manifest their existence as a nominal power.  Unlike other beings in the cosmos they cannot be killed or destroyed - only bound and imprisoned, held apart so that they do not run wild across the cosmos.

**Why a Temple to Vecna:** The Amber Temple appears to be dedicated to Vecna.  This is both true and not true.  It reflects the impact Vecna has had on the metaphysical Amber Temple.  In ages past Vecna discovered the true Amber Temple.  Always hungry for power, Vecna laboured and unbound one of the Dark Powers imprisoned there - the Serpent - and struck a bargain with it.  The Serpent and Vecna are one, and their powers are the same.  

**The Path From Here:** The party will have to do the following to move on from here:
* Discover the nature of the Temple, the nature of the Dark Powers so that they can use it to secure the cosmos against Vecna's ritual (if the players fail this Kas can be used to provide this information).  They may also realize that Vecna has liberated one of the Dark Powers, but that is mostly flavour text.
* Convince at least one of the Vestiges in the Amber Temple (shards of the Dark Powers) that they should be let go.  Bonus points if they convince the Dark Powers to let them free Kas to go with them.  
* Strike a bargain (no matter how convincing the party is, they will have to strike a bargain to gain the assistance of the Dark Powers).

## Food and Drink in Barovia
### Foods in Barovia
#### Morgantha's Dream Pies
Eating one of Morgantha's pies has one of the following effects:
* If eaten as a bonus action in combat you may add 1d4 to any attack roll or saving throw in the next minute.
* If eaten outside of combat it heals 2d4+2 hp
* If eaten before a long rest, you gain two extra hit dice to use during the next day.

However they are addictive.  The morning after you eat one roll a DC 10+2*(Total Number of Pies Eaten Lifetime) Constitution Save.  If they fail they become first level addicts.  Addicts have debuffs added to their character that make them weaker.  They can remedy this by eating a pie (from which they gain no other benefits - however eating subsequent pies does give them one of the benefits) or they can suffer through the addiction.  If they consume even a single pie during the day they run the risk of getting further addicted (make a new save the following morning).  If they go 24 hours without eating a pie the next morning they can make a save to drop down one level on the addiction chart.  *LPC stands for lifetime pie consumption - how many pies they have eaten total.  Track this!*

| Level | Impact | Con Save Better | Con Save Worse |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| First | +1 Exhaustion |  10+2x(LPC) | 12+2x(LPC) | 
| Second | +2 Exhaustion | 12+2x(LPC) | 14+2x(LPC) |
| Third | +3 Exhaustion | 14+2x(LPC) | -- |

### Drink in Barovia
Almost all alcohol in Barovia is wine or wine-based, and almost all wine is made by the Martikov family (some is brought in by Vistani traders).  A description of the Martikov family wines is below:

#### Grapesmash
Grapesmash is the lowest grade of Martikov wine.  It is a red wine, made from grapes unfit for any other purpose.  It is, however, widely available.  Grapesmash wines tend to be tannin heavy and have a bitter, metallic aftertaste.  The Martikov's sell three types of Grapesmash wines - Grapesmash #3, which is purely made from Grapesmash grapes (and thus has the most pronounced Grapesmash 'flavour') and Grapesmash #2 & #1 - each of which uses progressively more of the Martikov's other grapes to dull the harsh edge of Grapesmash.
 
#### Dragoncrush
Dragoncrush is a red varietal from the Martikov winery.  They make two varieties of this varietal - Red Dragoncrush and Black Dragoncrush - as well as a brandy which is made from Red Dragoncrush called Dragon's Breath.  Red Dragoncrush uses dried grapes and is aged in oak barrels, giving it a spicy, cinnamony flavour.  Black Dragoncrush mixes fresh Dragoncrush grapes with Winterstomp grapes to give it a fresh, crisp flavour.  Dragon's Breath Brandy leans into the natural flavours of Red Dragoncrush, and is very spicy.  

#### Winterstomp
Winterstomp is a white varietal from the Martikov winery.  They are mainly used to balance the flavours of the Martikov Red varietals, as the grapes themselves are almost too acidic on their own.  The Martikov's do make a sparkling Winterstomp wine that is somewhat refreshing (if very acidic).
