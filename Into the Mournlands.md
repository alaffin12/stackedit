# Into the Mournlands
Having saved Professor House from death, the party finishes making their way to Vathirond,  Leaving Vathirond he finally confides in the party:

> "So, now I keep my end of the bargain.  We seek none other than the enigmatic Warforged messiah himself, the Lord of Blades.  He rose to power so quickly in the Mournlands following the Day of Mourning that I am certain he was present in Cyre before it happened.  Given his attitude towards us Fleshbound he might even have been behind it.  
> 
> "I will repeat my warning - the Lord of Blades is dangerous.  He is a fanatical zealot in his pursuit of supremacist ideologies.  And he is strong - far stronger than a typical Warforged.  But he is also intelligent, and his zealous pursuit of his cause creates in him a kind of dichotomy.  If we talk to him, tell him how having the true history put to paper will help his cause, his people?  He will listen.  He is operating in the shadow of what was once Mount Ironrot.  During the war - before the Day of Mourning - there was a significant battle fought there, with both sides using colossi - think Warforged, but on a massive scale - as weapons.  The Lord of Blades has been here for several months, seeking to recover the spirits of the colossi, or perhaps repair their bodies even.  We must find him and make contact with him there..."

## Mount Ironrot and Surrounds
As the characters search for the Lord of Blades around Mount Ironrot they will have to deal with the negative effects left behind by the Day of Mourning:

### Regional Effects
The area is affected by these environmental phenomena:
* **Impeded Navigation.** In outdoor areas, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to navigate
*  **Lightly Obscured.** Mist perpetually shrouds outdoor areas, rendering them lightly obscured.
*  **Muddled Magic.** Creatures and objects within one mile of Mount Ironrot cannot be perceived through magical scrying sensors.  Spells or magical artifacts that would reveal a creatures of objects location are inaccurate, only revealing they are in the vicinity of Mount Ironrot.

###  Travelling
Because of the nature of the areas around Mount Ironrot travel is difficult.  When the party travels from one location to another roll 2d4 to determine the number of hours it takes for the party to reach their destination.  Have the players designate one party member to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check on behalf of the group - if the check fails the travel time is doubled (also note that Wisdom (Survival) checks are made at disadvantage).

Track the time.  If the party is caught outside of a noted area (the Veterans' Camp, Ialos or Landro) when the sun goes down at 19:00 (they can travel again at sunrise - 0600) then they will be forced to camp outside for the night.  It is easy enough to make camp, and relatively safe as well (even the dangerous predators of the Mournlands do not travel the mists after dark) but everyone in the part will be exposed to the Corruption of the Mournlands (see below).  They will also be exposed to this if they eat any food grown or killed or drink any water from rivers in the Mournlands (this includes goodberries made from berries picked in the Mournlands).  

### Dangers
Aside from the encounters required to flesh out the story travelling in the Mournlands is a dangerous proposition.  For every hour spent travelling roll 1d100.  If the party rolls 12 or lower, then generate a random encounter, using the following list as a guide for ideas:

* A battlefield where a Death Knight can be seen raising a company of undead.  Those he has raised have lined up, three rows deep behind him, and a quick count suggest there are at least sixty at his command
* A living spell of "Seeming".  Disguise characters as previous iterations of themselves, or characters they have met.
* A living spell of "Raise Dead" battling a living spell of "Animate Dead".  The party wanders into a battlefield where the dead seemingly die and then are brought back to life, only to die again - switching from side of side.  
* A literal rain of arrows begins falling from the sky.  Players make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 piercing damage on a failed save.  Allow them to figure out how to shelter, but add pressure with further saves if they do not find it quickly.  This will delay them 2d4 hours.
* Ask who is leading the party.  The party hears a loud thrumming sound, but cannot identify the source (it's hidden in the mists).  Suddenly there is a large "pew" sound, and a ray of raw radiant energy blasts the lead member of the party.  The target takes 11d10 radiant damage (DC 26 Dexterity save for half).  The beam clears the mists somewhat, revealing the source - a massive arm, sticking up from the ground like a tower, with the beam eminating from a massive crystal on the 'palm' of the tower.  As the mists close in again the party sees the crystal start to glow, and hears the thrumming once more - though at a much lower note.
* A small brook of warm, salty water (tears).  Any character touching it is asked to describe their character's greatest tragedy, and will suffer disadvantage on all Charisma checks and saves until the next long rest as they are disturbed by it.
* A field of corpses.  As the party walks by each of the corpses speak a single phrase.  Most are calls to a loved one, but have the party each roll a Charisma saving throw.  The character rolling the lowest is asked to share their character's greatest secret (in one sentence) - which is what one of the dead bodies says.  That character suffers disadvantage on all Wisdom checks and saving throws until their next long rest as they are disturbed by it.
* The players see a ghostly apparition of a young woman, carrying the body of a man about the same age down a hill, her yellow hair wrapped around him.  Where her feet fall a purple-pink flower springs up, then rapidly dies.  A strange mournful tune (the Dowie Dens of Yarrow) plays fills the air as she walks.
* The party encounters an empty farmhouse.  If they go in the house it is set as if ready for a meal - the plates are full and hot, the tankards full and cold, as if the family might return to sit down and eat at any time.  A single word is written on the wall in blood.  "Why?"
* The party sees a spectral company of children, arrayed as if they were soldiers.  They march across a battlefield, stopping every so often to inspect a corpse.  Every time they stop one of the children falls out, inspects the body and begins to wail - it has found its missing parent.  It then sinks into the ground, and a black rose grows where it descended into the earth.

### Corruption of the Mournlands
Characters who sleep in the Mournlands, or who consume food or drink from the Mournlands, have to make a DC 12 Constitution save or fall prey to the corruption that permeates what was once Cyre.  If they fail, have them roll 1d100 and use the following table to determine the effects:

### Intrigue in the Wasteland
Most would not consider the Mournlands a hotbed for intrigue, but in the shadow of Mount Ironrot three factions are struggling with one another.  Kalyth's Veterans are looking to rebuild the lives of Cyrans who escaped the horrors of the Day of Mourning.  Mercy's Pilgrims seek to honour the dead warforged in the valley, memorializing them as a stepping stone to further understanding their own existence.  The Blade's Warriors seek to control the valley for themselves, as their god-king seeks to ressurect the colossi that inhabit the valley and build an army capable of ruling all of Eberron.  Central to this conflict will be the colossi docents....

#### Colossi Docent
True docents were invented in Xen'drik in ages past.  Created by the giants, they best described as a warforged without a body - specifically a keenly intelligent mind from an age long past, capable of advising it's attuned owner - who must be a warforged - on a myriad of subjects.

The colossi docents are an imitation, reverse engineered by the craftsmen of House Cannith during the Last War.  Like a true docent they are intelligent in the own right, but they are not nearly so advanced.  Instead they are designed to connect remotely to a warforged controlling a true docent.  In this manner a single warforged can command an entire platoon of colossi.  

Near Mount Ironrot one such platoon existed, which is why so many colossi (and docents) can be found there.  Most of the docents are inactive (they do not work and do not have an special properties) but some are still active.  

An active colossi docent has the following qualities.  It still requires a warforged to us, but unlike true docents they do not require attunement:
***
**Sentience.** Colossi docents have something akin to sentience. They have an INT of 11, WIS of 6 and CHA of 4. They are naturally servile and follow orders very well.  
**Specialist Knowledge.** Every colossi docent is designed to augment the battlefield capacity of the warforged it has bonded with.  It grants advantage on all appropriate skill checks on the field of battle as determined by the GM.
**Network Protocol.** The colossi is always aware of its central node and can always locate it in any direction.
***

Although an active colossi docent requires a warforged to operate properly, even a non-warforged can tell it appears to have some kind of sapience and will feel it pulled towards the central node.

An active colossi docent is worth 1000 gp to House Cannith.  An inactive one is worth 200 gp.  With two active colossi docents the party can triangulate the location of Landro (if they can figure it out what is happening and why they seem to pull them in a direction).

#### Conflict
The conflict for this adventure is in the three different groups somewhat conflicting interests.  The Cyran Veterans want to collect docents and sell them to House Cannith.  They are very valuable, the the Cyran's regard them as the 'property' of those survivors of Cyre (as they are not true warforged, who have been emancipated).  The pilgrims regard the docents (as well as many of the pieces of old warforged found in the valley) as the remains of their war dead, and wish to see them treated as such.  The Warriors want to find and take control of Landro, using him and the other colossi as an integral part of their army (they already have their two active colossi docents and the Lord of Blades has located Landro).

#### Expected Path
This is kind of an open ended adventure where players can make their own way to the final dungeon (Landro).  Assuming players don't just murder hobo their way through the two expected paths would be:

(1) Meet Veterans -> Veterans' Camp -> Comb Colossi -> Collect Active Docent -> Become Aware Docents Pull to Landro -> Collect Second Active Docent -> Go to Landro

(2) Meet Veterans -> Veterans' Camp -> Go to Ialos -> Convince Mercy to Help -> Steal Active Docent From Veterans -> Go to Landro.  

However I can imagine the party talking themselves into meeting with the Blades and working something out with them.  Be open to their ideas and try to make them work!

#### Time 
Time is going to be very important.  See the section labelled travelling and keep track of time.  Spending too long in the mists can be problematic...

#### Setting the Stage
*Since this event is 'scripted' it occurs around 10:00 on the first day in the Mournlands.*
> Navigating the Mournlands is difficult.  Professor House warned you that was inhospitable, but experiencing it first hand is something else.  It is as if everything is twisted and bent, corrupted by some all pervasive magic.  The most obvious sign of it are the mists, with shroud everything in grey shadows.  But even just the way the air feels oily, tastes metallic, sounds like a tinny, metallic ringing in the distance.  You know you do not want to spend too many nights here....
> As you wander you become aware of someone following you.  The signs are subtle, but they are there.  Sounds just out of sight.  Movement in the corner of your eyes.  But the damn mists hide everything.  Then suddenly a figure steps out of the haze, hand on his blade.  He looks like he once would have cut a regal figure in his half-plate and green cloak.  But they look tattered with age and wear.  "Halt..." he says, looking each one of your in the eye, his hand never leaving the hilt of his sword "...state your business friends.  We don't take kindly to scavengers picking over the bones of Cyre.  Whatever is here belongs to Cyrans."

Sergeant Napper (veteran) and his five veteran soldiers had been out scavenging themselves (but they are Cyran, so it doesn't count) when they happened upon the party.  They've had problems with warforged lately (most the Lord of Blades' followers) so got ready for a fight, but since the party are not all warforged they decided to give them a chance.  Assuming the party gives them some kind of story that makes sense Sergeant Napper will comment that they should not be out wandering the Mournlands and will lead them to the Veteran's Camp, where the party can speak to Captain Kayleth.

If the party decides to go hostile instead the veterans will pull back and attack the party from range.  They are very adept at fighting in the Mournland, and will shoot and scoot, using the mists to their advantage.  If the players choose this route some improvisation will be necessary.  

#### The Veteran's Camp
*Since this event is 'scripted' it occurs around 11:00 on the first day in the Mournlands.*
> The camp is not much.  Set up next to a crumbling bridge over an green river it consists of little more than a handful of tents, a small fire pit and an odd looking device that crackles and hums with arcane energies.

The Veteran Camp is a grim place.  To a man the soldiers present are survivors of the last war.  They are a people who lost their home land and loved ones four years ago.  On top of that, this 'expedition' has not been very successful - having been plagued by 'bucket-heads' at every turn.  Morale is low, and the presence of outsiders is not helping anything.  

> You are escorted into an important looking tent, where a broad shouldered, Orc with a large scar along her jaw and braided black hair is sitting, staring at a map.  
> She looks up at you, her yellow eyes quickly evaluating you.  Judging you.  "Welcome..." she says, her tone cautious and guarded "...I do not mean to be rude, but you should not be here.  Cyre belongs to the Cyrans, and we don't take kindly to looters trying to steal our treasures."

Assuming the party gives her some kind of story (Professor House may volunteer that he is 1/16th Cyran on his maternal grandmother's side) that is believable (deception checks if necessary) she will be reasonably friendly - for some definition of friendly anyway.
***
##### Captain Kalyth
Kalyth’s story is one of resilience forged in the fires of war and loss. Born in Cyre, she rose through the ranks of its military with a mix of raw talent and sheer determination, eventually earning command over a detachment of scouts and rangers. Skilled in hit-and-run tactics and reconnaissance, she and her unit fought across Khorvaire, harrying enemy forces with precision and guile. But on the Day of Mourning, fate spared her not through strength, but cruel chance—her company had been deployed in Breland, leaving them untouched by the cataclysm that swallowed their homeland. When word of Cyre’s destruction reached them, the cohesion of her unit shattered. Many abandoned their posts, seeking refuge in whatever nation would take them, while Kalyth, stricken with grief and guilt, drowned herself in drink, aimless in a world that no longer held a place for her.

It took years for her to find purpose again. As she wandered the remnants of Cyre’s displaced people, she saw too many of her fellow veterans discarded, unwanted by the nations they had fought beside. That was when she found her new cause—not vengeance, not justice, but survival. Gathering lost and disillusioned soldiers, she carved out a hard-won existence leading expeditions into the Mournland, ‘reclaiming’ the wealth of a fallen nation and selling it to the highest bidder. Unlike reckless scavengers, Kalyth understands the Mournland’s horrors.  She uses a pricey device - invented by a friend and fellow Cyran, which allows for the worst of the Mournland's negative effects to be negated and she enforces strict limits on how long her people remain inside its cursed borders. Yet even with her precautions, the land takes its toll, and she alone bears the worst of it—her body slowly succumbing to its mutagenic blight. It is a secret she keeps fiercely guarded, for she knows that without her, the fragile brotherhood she has built might collapse, and she refuses to let Cyre’s last survivors be scattered to the wind once more.
***

Kalyth has the following information, which might be useful to the party:
* The Lord of Blades' followers are operating in the area.  Her party has has several hostile encounters with them, and her men have orders to avoid contact if at all possible.  She's already lost a man to them when several bucket-heads ambushed an expedition.
* She does not know where the followers of the Lord of Blades is, however her expedition have sighted his followers near several of the colossi.  In addition, one expedition sighted a group of bucket-heads near Ialos.
* She can provide directions to Ialos and nearby colossi.  If they are going to the colossi then she'll offer them a deal - bring back a colossi docent, active or not, and she will split its value with them fifty-fifty.  "This trip has been a shit show, what with the bucket-heads about.  I need to make back enough to get Aram the raw materials to build another one of his devices and pay the men something."  If they agree to this she will also let them sleep in her camp, eat her rations - away from the most deleterious effects of the mists.
* She is able to mount missions into the Mournlands because of the device at the centre of camp.  "I don't know how it works, even if I was inclined to explain it to you.  Aram - a Cyran artificer I know - builds them for me.  It holds back the mists.  Keeps it from rotting you.  It's not perfect - I rotate my men out every expedition to make sure they don't spend too much time here - but it makes this possible at least."  

#### Next Steps
If the players have reached an agreement with the Veterans they are likely headed to Ialos or a nearby colossi.  If someone else has happened, the best path is probably have them wander up to either a colossi or into Ialos (maybe both).  

#### Colossi 
The colossi are mostly unremarkable, save for how massive they are.  Each one is the size of a Storm Giant, and is equipped with massive weaponry.  When the party arrives at one roll 1d100 to determine what (if anything) the party encounter when they arrive:

| Roll  | Result |
|--|--|
| 00-09 | Blades Ambush |
| 10-39 | Blades Attack |
| 40-49 | Blades Present |
| 50-59 | Pilgrims Present |
| 60-99 | Nothing... |

For any dealing with the blades, roll up a raiding party on the following table:
| NPC | Number |
| -- | -- |
| Blade Lieutenant | 1d2-1 |
| Blade Scout | 1d4-1 |
| Warforged Warrior | 1d8 |

These are members of the Blades who are present at the colossus, looking for docents.  If the party roles an ambush, the Blades attack them with surprise.  If the party rolls and attack the Blades spot them, but they spot the blades and can approach on equal footing (or flee).  If they roll the Blades are present they have the opportunity to set an ambush of their own (or flee).  

If they roll for Pilgrims present then 1d8 Warforged Warriors are present at the site of the colossus.  They are non-hostile, and will avoid confrontation with the party, but the party may choose to attack them (if they are not away of the pilgrims presence in the area and assume they are with the Blades) or root around inside the colossus which may cause problems with their relations with the other pilgrims.  

Otherwise no one is present.

If the players are aware of valuable docents possibly being inside a colossus they might try and find it.  If they choose to search the colossus roll 1d4.  On a 1 or 2 they find nothing.  On a 3 they find an inactive docent.  On a 4 they find an active docent.  If they find nothing allow them to roll another 1d4.  On a 1 on that roll they find nothing.  On a 2 or a 3 they find tracks which lead away from the colossus which if they follow will lead them to another colossus in 1d4 hours (no survival checks needed).  On a 4 they find tracks which will lead them to Ialos in 1d4 hours (no survival check needed).

#### Ialos
Depending on the party Ialos could be a messy location.  Try to play it as best you can:

> Ialos was, perhaps, once a bucolic and pastoral village.  You can see, as you approach, that it was built around a windmill - a place where farmers would bring their grains to have it ground into grist. 
>
> But it is bucolic no more.  Whatever happened here, whatever befell Cyre, reduced the town to rubble.  Now only the windmill, and a strange statue in front of it, remains standing.  All else is reduced to rubble.  

*If the party investigates the statue:*
> The statue is... odd.  It is unremarkable in many ways - it is a simple statue of a gnome.  The craftsman was not a master by any stretch - it is a humble statue, made of inferior materials and with harsh angles instead of smooth lines.  But it was clearly made lovingly and with care.  And whatever calamity befell Ialos, it has survived.
>
>Adding to its oddness is that it is clothed, after a fashion.  Bright coloured cloths are draped and tied over the statue, like small flags.  Each piece is different and unique - different sizes, different colors, different materials - but together they serve as a kind of grand, unique robe for the statue.  The kind usually reserved for kings and emperors.

*If the party investigates the windmill:*

> The windmill is in rough shape, but it is in far better condition than the rest of Ialos.  The walls mostly stand (although it appears that an outbuilding has caved in somewhat) and the arms of the windmill have been patched with metal sheets, although to what end you are not sure - the air in the former village is unnaturally still.
>
> Entering the mill you can see that, for the most part it has been disassembled.  The millstones have been removed, and instead the area is open and you can see signs that people have been here recently.  To the right a set of stairs descends down beneath the mill.

*If the party moves to go downstairs:*
> As you approach the stairs a soft voice come from just outside the doors.  "Friends, please..." it says "...a moment if you will.  You are treading in a sacred place, and I fear in your ignorance you may desecrate it."  In the doorway stands a warforged, draped in a long robe, looking at you.  He is - as far as you can see - unarmed.

Mercy has intervened, by pass the next bit and move on to the party's interaction with him.  Otherwise, if the party elects not to go down into the but instead returns to the outside:

>As you step outside you find yourself surrounded by a dozen warforged, all angrily brandishing staves and clubs at you.  Another warforged, one wearing long robes stands and who is generally unarmed stands in between them and you.  "Brothers and sisters..." he says, clearly talking to the other warforged although he does not move his wary gaze from you "...violence is not the answer.  The fleshbound have caused us offense, but it was done from ignorance - not malice.  Peace - too much blood has been shed in these lands."

##### Mercy

Mercy is a solemn yet resolute warforged, his once-polished frame now weathered by years of exile in the Mournland. Unlike others of his kind who seek vengeance or dominion, he has wholly rejected violence, believing that war and bloodshed have already claimed too many of his brethren. He speaks with measured conviction, his voice filled with sorrow but never rage. Once a soldier like all warforged, Mercy was shaped by suffering—his own and that of his kin. In the wake of the Last War, he saw his people cast adrift, many hunted, abused, or discarded by the very nations that had built them. The Treaty of Thronehold, while granting them freedom, also left them abandoned, and to Mercy, it was nothing less than an official sanctioning of their slow extinction.

Fleeing persecution, he and a growing number of like-minded warforged found solace in the desolate expanse of the Mournland, where they have dedicated themselves to a solemn duty: honoring their fallen. Near the rusting remains of countless warforged warriors, Mercy and his followers are constructing a vast ossuary, a monument to those who were spent and discarded in the Last War’s relentless machine. Though the Lord of Blades preaches war and conquest, Mercy believes in remembrance and reconciliation. Yet even in the desolation of the Mournland, dangers abound, and while Mercy’s ideals forbid him from taking up arms, not all who dwell in the wastes are as bound by principle.
***

Mercy has the following information, which might be useful to the party:
* The Lord of Blades' followers are operating in the area.  Mercy believes he is trying to reactivate Landro and rebuild other colossi, in the hopes of creating an army of war machines in his service.  
* He knows how to find Landro, but is not inclined to help the players.  "He will attack you, or you will attack him.  I understand you have your reasons for seeking him out, just as he has his reasons for hating the fleshbound.  Either way - I will not be responsible for more bloodshed."  If the players want they can try to convince him to help them.  Force a check with a high DC (allow the players some leeway, and reward creativity with a lower DC, but at least 15 - if they lie about their reasons also force a deception check with a similar DC - failing leads to disadvantage on the main check).  If they convince him to help he will say he must consult with the others, but he will come back with an offer.  "My brothers and sisters have agreed that we should aid your quest, but there is a caveat.  I said that I knew how to find Landro, but while I know how I do not yet possess the means.  To do that I will need you to retrieve something from the human encampment."  Mercy requires two active docents to triangulate the location of Landro.  He currently has one in the ossuary beneath the windmill, but he knows the humans have one as well.
* Mercy knows most of the lore about docents.  Him and his followers regard them as kindred to warforged, and thus worthy of the same treatment and respect - hence placing one in the ossuary, and wanting to retrieve another from the veterans.
* If asked about the veteran's mission Mercy will respond rather plainly "I sympathize with their plight.  No one emerged from the Last War without scars, but the people of Cyre lost more than most.  But should their suffering entitle them to rummage through the remains of the dead?  I do not see them digging up the bodies of their fallen in graveyards to fund their new lives.  Why should they be allowed to desecrate dead warforged?"
* If asked about the Lord of Blades Mercy will respond rather plainly "He is violent, and he only brings ruin on his own kind.  But his rage - I understand it.  I feel it too.  So many of you fleshbound herald the Treaty of Thronehold as a step towards equality for my kind.  Yes, it emancipates us.  But it is also a genocide.  You have banned the creation of new warforged.  And so we will grow old.  And we will be damaged.  And we will die.  Imagine you fleshbound being told you could no longer reproduce.  What would you do?"

#### Back to the Veterans' Camp
If the party convinces Mercy to help them and they agree to steal an active docent for them Mercy will personally lead the party back to the camp (taking 1d4 hours, but with Mercy's guidance they can move after dark).  He will implore the party not to kill anyone - just retrieve the docent and flee.  He will be waiting for them in the mists to lead them safely back to Ialos when they are done.
