### Prelude
#### The Suicide Charge
##### Level 10
Players are summoned by three of the most powerful wizards in the multiverse - Elminster of Faerun, Mordenkainen of Oerth and Raistlin of Krynn - to help stop a powerful foe - Vecna - as he tries to unmake the universe.  They fail, but Mordenkainen's contingency activates at the last minute - throwing the party back in time about a year.  In the process, however, Mordenkainen is removed from the timeline altogether.

### Act I - Return to Sigil
#### Scene I - The Spider Cult
##### Level 11
Hurled back in time about a year, the party awakens to find themselves somewhere in the Underdark of Faerun.  A sigil on their hands begins to glow, and Mordenkainen appears to the party revealing that he has sent them back in time a decade, to the deck of a Spelljammer capable of taking them to Sigil.  He charges them with a simple, but important task - find him and warn him that Vecna is stirring.  

Of course it is obvious to the party that the spell did not work, but they might not be immediately aware of how wrong the spell went.  Assuming they don't just sit in the Underdark and wait for the end they will soon stumble onto Web's Edge.  

Web's Edge is a Sanctum/Field Office for the operations of the Cult of Lolth.  It presents an obstacle to them, but also an opportunity - within is an ally who can get them closer to Sigil, and also a powerful relic (the Eye of Vecna) which might both aid and hinder them

#### Scene II - The Lambent Zenith
##### Level 12
Reunited with his Silver Sword, Ahmaz the Githyanki teleports the party to his Spelljammer on the Astral Plane, only to find it run around on the corpse of a dead god.  The party will have to help Ahmaz and the crew free the ship if they are to use it to reach Sigil.

#### Scene III - Sigil
##### Level 12
The party has reached Sigil, but Mordenkainen is nowhere to be found.  In fact no one seems to know the name which is strange, considering his fame generally reaches across the multiverse.  
{{Maybe add a short adventure here}}

#### Scene IV - Mordenkainen's Mysterious Mansion
##### Level 12
The players eventually find Mordenkainen's Mansion in Sigil, but it has seemingly been abandoned.  However the mark on their hands - the ones that Mordenkainen used to send them back through time and and reveal to them his plan - seem to activate the systems inside the Mansion.  
Mordenkainen was a prolific writer, and his notes are scattered all across the Mansion.  After some investigation the party finds that Mordenkainen was attempting to thwart Vecna, but it would seem he ran out of time.  One particular note reads:
> What a stupid thing, the Ritual of Remaking.  Who could have possibly thought that the multiverse would be so fragile that such a simple spell - something even a novice could cast - could undo it all.  Fortunately it is mostly self-correcting.  It is easy enough to pull on the loose threads of creation, it is much more difficult to do so without unraveling one's self.  Of course leave it to Vecna to work out how to do it.  One hates to admit it, but that contemptible lich has a knack for finding loopholes to exploit.  The trick is to unravel everything slowly!  Of course it is, I suppose, but how does one slowly unravel reality?
> It's in the very nature of reality, of course.  In all my travels I have found that every realm in the cosmos, great and small, is built on what I call a foundational fact.  They are often shrouded in mystery, but - to extend the whole fabric/thread metaphor - they form the base pattern upon which everything else is woven. 
> But those foundational facts can change.  Vecna is trying to change them - perhaps even has changed them.  So in turn I must stabilize them.  I have crafted a tome - I call it the Book of True Balance.  If I can understand these foundational facts I can put them in the tome and stabilize them.  Will it stop Vecna?  I doubt it.  He is crafty - nearly as well-versed in magic as I am and quite tenacious.  But if he cannot control these foundational facts he will be forced to use other, less reliable means to carry out his plans.  And that will make him weaker.
> By my reckoning six core secrets will be needed to stabilize the fabric of reality against Vecna's meddling.  So far my research has revealed one.  When I have all six I will move openly against the lich, snap them up and snatch his victory away from him.  
> Thankfully with the Orrey of the Spheres there is no realm beyond my grasp.  Even the ones that are usually inaccessible.  The first secret is the cause of the Day of Mourning in Eberron.  Such a tragedy - an entire nation wiped off the map in less than an hour.  But from it an entire ethos was born, something that can be used to save not just Eberron, but all of existence!
