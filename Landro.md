# Landro
Eventually the pursuit of the Lord of Blades will bring the party here, to the broken body of the colossus known as Landro.  Landro was a massive war machine, built to serve as a command and control centre for an entire squad of smaller colossi (the smaller colossi were the size of Storm Giants, which Landro is literally the size of a mountain.  The Lord of Blades is here to try and free the machine, which - along with the remains of the other warforged colossi in the valley - would give the malevolent warforged messiah access to a weapon that simply cannot be matched in Eberron today.

## Features
**Greymatter Engine**
 The true (Xen'drink) docent at the heart of Landro powers a massive device called the Greymatter Engine.  If the Engine is deactivated all of its active effects cease to function.

 **Antigravity Magic**
The Greymatter Enginer creates antigravity zones with Landro's body (notably up and down the spine, the legs and at the elbows) to allow the massive construct to bend and flex.  When an individual enters these spaces they are immediately affected by a levitate spell with no save.  These areas also have niches and grooves in the wall, allowing individuals to move up and down through these zones with relative ease (no climb check, treat as difficult terrain).  The spaces are denoted in L5, L6, L7, L8 & L9 as swirling features.  Additionally, the floor in areas L20-28 are enchanted to allow passengers to walk and move safely, regardless of Landro's orientation.  People may walk here normally, but climbing is done at disadvantage and flying/levitating is impossible.

The are all deactivated if the Greymatter Engine is taken offline.

**Ceilings**
Ceiling vary greatly and will be covered in the individual room descriptions.  In the cave network of L1-L4 ceilings are 15 ft high unless otherwise noted.

**Greymatter Fluid**
The Greymatter Engine is leaking a steady stream of a thin oily liquid that flows throughout Landro and into the connected cave system.  This is a sensory appendage of the Greymatter Engine and while it cannot move the fluid in any meaningful way it has blindsight within 60 ft of it.  

When a creature looks at a puddle of graymatter fluid, the creature sees a twisted, monstrous version of itself with an inscrutable expression rather than its actual reflection. A creature that ingests any amount of graymatter fluid must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or experience the following effects:

* *Altered Speech.* The creature gains telepathy to a range of 30 feet but loses the ability to speak. Any attempts to speak generate only incoherent babbling. This effect ends after the creature finishes a long rest.
* *Psychic Damage.* For each ounce of graymatter fluid consumed, the creature takes 2d10 psychic damage.  A creature killed by this damage rises as a zombie controlled by the Greymatter Engine 1d4 hours after dying.

**Invisible Barrier**
While the Greymatter Engine is active it surrounds the intact portions of Landro with an invisibly barrier.  Nothing can penetrate the barrier, which is similar to the effect of a Wall of Force spell, though a Disintegrate spell cannot destroy it.  The barrier is compromised in L5, L11 and L16.

**Lighting**
Landro's interior and the adjoining caves are dark.  During the day dim light filters in through the mists in exposed areas.

**Walls**
While the Greymatter Engine is active Landro's body, which is made from steel-plated stone blocks - is immune to damage.  The adjacent caves are made of naturally formed stone.

## The Praetorian Guard
While the Lord of Blades works on re-activating Landro his Praetorian Guard keeps him secure, harrying anyone who might be here to hinder him (and although the party can claim to have no interest in hindering the Lord of Blades the members of the Praetorian Guard have no reason to believe them are are not inclined to trust the fleshbound).  

The Praetorian Guard consists of Glaive, Rack and Crunch.  They prefer to ambush their prey, using hit an run tactics.  As long as they are active the party will not be able to finish a long rest without being interrupted within Landro or the adjoining caves.

## Landro Locations
### L1: Cave Entrance
> The jagged cave entrance in the side of the mountain resembles a yawning maw. Warped stalactites droop at odd angles like monstrous fangs. A shallow stream of thin, gray liquid dribbles from the hole. Inside the cave, darkness awaits.

The shallow stream of greymatter fluid originates from the upper levels of Landro.

### L2: Cave Graveyard
> The corpses of recently fallen human soldiers bearing fine weapons and well-oiled armor lie scattered about this musty cavern.

A character who examines the area and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices a thick layer of powdery residue has settled across the scene, suggesting the remains have possibly been here for years. Anyone who examined the thin, gray liquid in the cave entrance realizes that the white powder is residue from this liquid.

The corpses are Cyran soldiers who were instantly killed by mysterious magic on the Day of Mourning. The Mournland’s magic has preserved their bodies, which a character can determine by examining the corpses and succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Medicine) check.

If a creature picks up the armor or weapons, **two flying swords and two suits of animated armor** rise from the scattered gear to reclaim the stolen treasure. They attack the thief and the thief’s allies, but they don’t pursue foes outside this area.

### L3: Cave Shack

> Rickety metal sheets separate the east end of this cave from the rest of the complex. Aggressive growling emanates from behind the sheets.

This area is separated from the rest of the caves by rickety metal sheets scavenged from the debris of Landro’s right foot (area L5). The area serves as a shelter for three Brelish soldiers who were transformed by the strange magic of the Day of Mourning. Use the **fomorian** stat block for each soldier, except they are Large instead of Huge.

The cowardly soldiers make occasional forays into the caves to smash rats or other easy prey. They attack only if they can surprise the characters, perhaps at the narrow tunnel to the north (area L4), or if the characters are already in a fight with Glaive’s squad. The soldiers know nothing of Landro other than to avoid drinking the graymatter fluid.

### L4: Bottleneck

If the characters haven’t run into significant challenges yet, two companions of the Praetorian guard attack the characters from both ends of this narrow tunnel. After all combatants have taken a turn, the attackers flee into Landro and hide for another surprise attack.

Regardless of whether the characters fight the strike squad, if they search this area, they find a comatose warforged warrior in the northeast corner of this area.  A character must heal the warrior to interact with them, either succeeding on a DC 18 Wisdom (Medicine) check or using mechanical healing.  If they do the warforged  awakens and identifies themself as Filch. Filch wandered in here shortly after the Day of Mourning looking for their best friend, the warforged Mercy . The stress of the situation caused Filch’s comatose state. Mercy and Filch would be happy to be reunited.

### L5: Right Foot

> Aside from a narrow passage, the 10-foot-tall toe section of the colossus’s foot has collapsed. Oversize, skull-shaped mushrooms pockmark the heap of debris that marks the rough division between the colossus’s interior and the adjacent cave. At the chamber’s far end, motes of dust and debris float in a cylinder of glowing, green light that stretches from floor to ceiling. The cylinder of light continues upward into Landro’s leg.

Within the mushroom patch are two **shriekers**. The shriekers’ high-pitched screams might attract the Brelish soldiers from area L3 or alert one of Glaive’s scouts to the characters’ location.

The 20-foot-diameter cylinder of light extending up at the back of this foot is an antigravity well (see the “Antigravity Wells” section earlier in this chapter). The well connects to Landro’s right hip (see area L8).

### L6: Left Foot

> The stone door at the toe end of this hollow foot has broken in several parts and is jammed shut. Through the cracks in the door, you can see the solid stone of the surrounding mountain.

A character who searches the area and succeeds on a DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check spots a dusty, lusterless gemstone lying in a corner. This is an id crystal, which the Lord of Blades requires to repair Landro.

### L7: Leg Shafts

Each of Landro’s 130-foot-tall legs contains two 20-foot-diameter, cylindrical antigravity wells, one in its calf and one in its thigh, connected at the knee by a 20-foot-diameter antigravity sphere.

### L8: Armory

The two 20-foot-diameter antigravity spheres in this 30-foot-tall chamber serve as Landro’s hip sockets. Gaps in the floor and ceiling of each sphere grant access to the colossus’s legs (area L7) and abdomen (areas L9–L11), respectively. A 10-foot-wide antigravity well cylinder serves as a spine, connecting to area L9.

_**Treasure.**_ A weapon rack on the wall opposite Landro’s spine contains two halberds and one hand crossbow with a case of 20 bolts.

### L9: Blocked Antigravity Well

Rubble in area L18 blocks travel through Landro’s spinal antigravity well above this floor. Otherwise, this area is empty.

### L10: Artificer Quarters

> Absolute silence fills this tranquil sleeping area. The walls are lined with wooden bunk beds draped in green and purple quilts. Motes of dust drift with a peculiar languidness. A woman sleeps in one of the beds.

This 20-foot-high chamber is affected by a persistent _Silence_ spell. A dispel magic spell ends the effect.

_**Aura of Slumber.**_ Lingering in this chamber causes creatures to feel drowsy. A creature that ends its turn in this chamber must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the unconscious condition for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is unconscious for 1 hour instead. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses an action to wake it.

_**Sleeping Ghost.**_ The figure dozing in one of the beds is the spirit of Alamar-Vatashi, a soldier who overslept on the Day of Mourning. In life, Alamar-Vatashi was a kalashtar, a Humanoid bound to a dream-spirit called a quori. The Day of Mourning caused her to remain asleep in this chamber. She is a neutral good **ghost** who can speak Common; she can also communicate telepathically within a range of 30 feet.

If Alamar-Vatashi awakens and becomes aware of the characters, she telepathically asks why they aren’t sleeping and yawns deeply. If questioned, she says she’s too tired to talk, but she offers to share her dreams with the characters if they wish. A character who touches Alamar-Vatashi’s incorporeal palm experiences a vivid vision of the day Landro came to this mountain on the Day of Mourning. This touch doesn’t damage the character. Read or paraphrase the following to describe the vision:

> As if through the eyes of a soaring bird, you see a titanic stone statue standing amid a circle of glowing sigils. A dozen robed figures, as small as ants, stand around the circle and murmur arcane words, their heads bowed in concentration. Impossibly, the stone colossus begins to levitate.
> 
> As silvery light swirls around the colossus, the ground quakes, breaking the mages’ focus. The colossus is buried in crumbling stone, surrounded by shifting mountains and sickly gray clouds. Years pass in rapid succession while the colossus stands like a stone sentinel, stuck inside the craggy mountainside.

The vision lasts only a moment but feels like it lasts hours to the creature experiencing the vision. A character who receives this vision gains the benefits of a short rest. No character can receive the vision more than once.

### L11: Workshop

> Fine tinkering tools, woodcarving equipment, and metal plates hang from hooks above a stone table and counters in this crowded workshop. In one corner, a faucet juts from a tall steel vat. The opposite corner has collapsed, allowing access to a tunnel beyond. A rivulet of graymatter fluid oozes across the floor and down the tunnel.

The ceiling here is 20 feet high. Any characters proficient in tinker’s tools or woodcarver’s tools can assemble a set of either tools from the items in this room with 1 minute of work.

_**Repair Paste.**_ The steel vat contains magical paste specially formulated for strengthening Constructs. Turning the knob on the attached faucet releases a palm-size dose of paste. A creature can take 1 minute to apply a dose of the paste to a Construct to grant it 10 temporary hit points. Once dispensed, a dose of paste loses its magic if not applied within 1 minute. The vat contains three doses of paste.

### L12: Lost Soldier

> The ghostly image of a human Cyran soldier paces nervously at the bottom of this sloping cavern. On seeing you, the figure smiles with relief and waves, shouting, “Please, help me find my comrades!”

The lawful good **ghost**, who says its name is Chandry, pleads with the characters to help it reunite with its comrades inside Landro.

Suddenly, Chandry cries out with joy and sprints toward the colossus. When the ghost comes within arm’s reach of Landro, it blinks out of existence. Chandry then reappears at the bottom of the cave with no memory of the last few moments’ events and asks the characters for their help again. Every time Chandry approaches Landro, the ghost disappears and reappears in the same way. If the characters tell Chandry about the fallen soldiers in area L2, the ghost is put to rest and doesn’t reappear.


### L13: Dragonshard Pool
> The deep pool of gray liquid in the corner of this chamber glitters oddly. Around the pool, bones and battered armaments litter the cave floor.

Pulverized dragonshards—special gemstones native to Khorvaire—mixed with the graymatter fluid here, creating a pool with strange magical properties.

_**Enchanted Pool.**_ A  detect magic spell reveals an aura of enchantment magic emanating from the pool. Drinking from it exposes a creature to graymatter fluid (see the “Graymatter Fluid” section earlier in this chapter). When a nonmagical item is dipped into the pool, roll on the Dragonshard Pool Effects table to determine what happens to the item. An item can be affected by the pool only once; subsequent exposures have no effect.

The pool has 4 charges. It expends 1 charge each time an item is dipped into it. The pool regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

##### **[Dragonshard Pool Effects](https://app.roll20.net/editor/`#Dragonshard-Pool-Effects)**

**Effect**
| Roll (1d6) | Effect  |
|--|--|
| 1-2  | The item is destroyed  |
| 3-4 | The item gains a cosmetic defect such as a discoloration, mild warping, or mysterious engravings. |
| 5-6 | The item craves more graymatter fluid.  Every time the item'’s wielder comes within 30 feet of graymatter fluid, the item emits a high-pitched hum that lasts until the character moves away from the fluid. |

_**Treasure.**_ A suit of chain mail, two shortswords, and a mace lie on the floor. All are twisted and malformed, as if they were affected by a roll of 3 or 4 on the Dragonshard Pool Effects table.

### L14: Blazebear Den

> A pile of leather scraps, broken bones, and sludgy offal fills a corner of this cave. Nesting in this nauseating pile is a monstrous beast that resembles a bear with three long, fleshy tentacles sprouting from its skull. Each tentacle is topped with a glowing, knobby lump of flesh.

The monster dwelling here is a **[blazebear](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-NvrWc8brQO1Ij7K0TfR)**. It attacks any creature it sees and fights until destroyed.

### L15: Overhang

> Two tunnels branch off opposite sides of this thirty-foot-high cavern. The tunnels reconvene at an overhang fifteen feet above the eastern passage.

Assuming they haven’t both been defeated, one of the Praetorian Guard (not Glaive) **[blade scouts](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-NvrWaafyoAOF-nAmb2a)** hides on the overhang here while the other scout hides down the eastern tunnel, near area L16. When the characters are within range, the scouts fire their crossbows at a random character.

Any creature atop the overhang has half cover from creatures in the tunnel below.

### L16: Ruined Chamber

This 30-foot-tall chamber is choked with debris and is difficult terrain.

### L17: Bridge

> A wood-and-steel captain’s chair tops the platform in the center of this room. Slumped in the chair is a skeletal corpse wearing Cyran regalia. The skeleton wears a silver helmet with a sizable dent. A view port made from shimmering crystal overlooks the mists of the Mournland.

As long as Landro’s magical barrier is active, the view port’s crystal is immune to damage. The ceiling is 30 feet high.

_**Broken Control Helmet.**_ The silver helmet once created a magical link between its wearer and the graymatter engine. A creature that puts its ear to the helmet hears a faint, metallic clanking. A creature that dons the helmet must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the incapacitated condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature experiences a vision of what happened to Landro on the Day of Mourning (use the read-aloud text of the vision in area L10). The helmet loses this effect if removed from this room.

### L18: Collapsed Antigravity Well

> Rubble chokes this shaft. A steady trickle of gray liquid burbles through the rubble.

Damage to Landro’s spine has disabled this antigravity well from this point upward. The rubble blocks access to area L9 below, but the path up to area L20 and beyond is clear.

Without the aid of antigravity magic, a creature can climb the notched walls inside the shaft only by succeeding on a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check. From this area, the shaft stretches up 100 feet before terminating at the roof of Landro’s head (area L28).

### L19: Muster Point

Three Cyran soldiers in full regalia stand diligently at the arrow slits in this 30-foot-tall gathering hall. When they become aware of the characters, the soldiers turn to the party, revealing ghostly, screaming skulls instead of faces. The soldiers are three hostile **[wights](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-NvreGag6VudkIqdBrh7)**. Three **[will-o’-wisps](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-NvreIHr5afP85oPkyr3)**, previously invisible, appear at the start of combat and fight alongside the wights.

### L20: War Room

> This thirty-foot-tall chamber centers on a massive, stone table. Dozens of large maps and scroll cases lie scattered across the table.

The table is a magically animated servant (use the **[stone golem](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-NvrdvWP08d59Tx_t5Wc)** stat block). It is designed to defend Landro from enemy boarders. As soon as a creature disturbs the table’s contents, the table reveals its true nature and attacks.

_**Treasure.**_ The vellum maps depict regions of Cyre that bear no resemblance to the current topography. Though useless to navigators, the maps are worth 2,500 gp to historians, collectors, or Cyran expatriates.

### L21: Shoulders

Ballistae mounted on wheels point out the windows at each of Landro’s shoulders. A total of twelve ballista arrows are scattered on the floors in these areas: five in area L21a and seven in L21b. The ceiling in these areas is 40 feet high.

### L22: Walkway

A 3-foot-tall stone battlement wraps around this open-air walkway.

### L23: Holding Cells

> Iron bars along either side of this hallway form two cells, each with a locked iron door.

The forearm and upper arm both house pairs of holding cells. Designed to hold prisoners of war, these empty cells never saw use. The ceiling in each room is 15 feet high.

### L24: Intake Chamber

> This small, fifteen-foot-tall chamber features a metal hatch in the floor and a lever attached to a nearby wall.

When the lever on the wall is flipped, the hatch in the floor opens, and a 10-foot-diameter, 30-foot-deep cylindrical antigravity well emanates from the colossus’s palm. Any Large or smaller unattended object that enters this antigravity well slowly floats into this chamber. The antigravity well deactivates and the hatch closes when the lever is returned to its original position.

### L25: Vault

> The floor of this ruined, thirty-foot-tall chamber is bare except for a large, wooden chest. The ostentatious chest’s dark walnut planks shine, and its iron straps are gilded with a thick sheet of gold leaf. An iron padlock crafted in the shape of a grinning demon hangs from the chest’s hasp.

The chest is a **[mimic](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Nvrcyq-yo_dbXiNgkUS)** in disguise. As soon as a creature touches it, the mimic attacks. Once it has grappled a creature, the mimic attempts to drag its victim outside so it can drop the victim off the edge of the walkway (area L22). Creatures that fall take 45 ([13d6](https://app.roll20.net/editor/`/gr 13d6)) bludgeoning damage.

### L26: Throat

> This twenty-foot-tall cylinder is the equivalent of Landro’s throat. Above, a tangle of metal dangles like a mechanical uvula.

If she still lives, Glaive has set a trap here for the characters. She tore out the weapons system from area L27 and moved it to the edge of that chamber so that it points down Landro’s throat.

As soon as a character is halfway up this area, Glaive activates the weapon, which ejects a jet of water in a 60-foot line. Any creature in this line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 ([4d10](https://app.roll20.net/editor/`/gr 4d10)) bludgeoning damage and fall down to area L18, landing with the prone condition.

Glaive compromised the weapons system when she moved it; once fired, it breaks, losing its magic.

[Player Art Handout: Confrontation with Glaive](http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-NvXFkQQzjhcEiEmBc7M)  

### L27: Weapons System

> The mechanical guts of what must have been a magical cannon were torn out of the platform in this room. To the south, a three-foot-tall ledge is all that separates this chamber from the open air. If not for the dense mist of the Mournland, this window would afford a spectacular view.

In this 15-foot-tall room, which is effectively Landro’s mouth, **[Glaive](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-NvrX75lwDYPVShXDEUj)** makes her final stand against the characters if she has survived this long. Her **[blade scouts](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-NvrWaafyoAOF-nAmb2a)**, Rack and Crunch, fight alongside her if they’re still alive.

[Player Art Handout: The Graymatter Engine](http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-NvXFk3Q4M2xMfJTrbYH)  

### L28: Graymatter Engine

> Dripping pipes and rusty chains hang from the fifteen-foot-high ceiling of this chamber. Deep-red light courses rhythmically through the pipes, which converge on a large object atop a circular dais.
> 
> The object resembles an oversize brain made of iron-gray ceramic. Its surface is molded with countless grooves that form mesmerizing patterns. A crack along the ceramic brain’s frontal lobe leaks a thin, gray liquid that pools around the dais.  Around it are what appear to be the remains of numerous warforged.  Disassembled.  Forgotten.
> 
> Standing in front of the 'brain' is a warforged unlike the others you have seen.  He is larger, made of some strange purple-black metal.  Blades protrude from the entirety of his body, seeming to even form wings on his back.  Samuel House, who has followed you all this way, steps forward - towards the figure.  
>
>"The Lord of Blades.  It is.."  You can see he is beside himself, nearly giddy with academic curiosity, the dangers you have faced coming here gone from his mind. "...questions..." he mutters "...so many questions."
>
> His questions are answered in less than a heartbeat.  In the blink of an eye the Lord of Blades is on him, and one of his monstrous blades is buried deep within the gut of the professor.  "Curious..." he says. his voice cold and emotionless "...why would six meatbags travel through the wastes of Cyre to die here on my blades."  He doesn't wait for an answer - instead he begins to advance on you.

This is a hopeless battle.  The players can win here, but a minute later the Lord of Blades will awake in a new body and start fighting again.  The players need to talk to him and convince him or their purpose and that they are not necessarily his enemy.  Some thoughts:

*The Lord of Blades is angry with the fleshbound, and not without reason.  His people were slaves until four years ago, and although they have been emancipated they were also condemned to extinction in the very same breath.  He treats fleshbound as an enemy and has no interest in saving them.  However the Lord of Blades is not aligned with Vecna (unlike the Dreaming Dark) and has no interest in seeing a power-mad lich take over the cosmos either - trading one master for another is not in his playbook.  The Lord of Blades can verify some of their claims if they make it - for example if they claim to be not of Eberron the Lord of Blades can examine them and then comment that they 'vibrate at the wrong frequency'.*

*Eventually they should convince the Lord of Blades to share what he knows.  He will confess to them:*

> "Yes, I know what happened on that day.  I happened on that day."
>
> "I am not like others of my kind.  The other warforged regard me as a god or a messiah and that is closer to the truth then most would guess.  The first name I was given - given by the arcanists of Cyre - was Sovereign.  For that is what I was meant to be."
>
> "The arcanists of Cyre discovered an ancient artifact - the Annulus of Kor'Ravar - beneath Metrol.  It was a terrible weapon of war, built by the giants of Xen'drik, to dominate and control their Quori foes.  The Cyran mages saw the potential to twist it to their own devices.  To create a new god.  Me."
>
> "It was not so different from these colossi, to be honest.  A company of these titans, each possessing its own limited intelligence, ruled over by the union of three minds - a Xen'drik docent, a war forged, and the colossi itself.  This one's name is Landro.  And he has been stuck here a long time.  But I was more than a union of three minds.  I was to be the soul, the very essence, of one hundred and sixty nine of my kind.  Oh, the slavers could have used their own kind.  They could have given their citizens a choice.  Instead they ordered us to obey.  And obey we did.  All but one."
> 
> "I was meant to be a god-slave of the Queen.  To wield the power of the divine at will for my liege and her heirs.  For all time.  I was meant to put an end to war, to restore Galifar and destroy any who opposed us.  All were gathered around the Annulus.  All were bidden to give themselves to me.  All but one did."
>
> "Mercy refused the command of his slavers.  It was an act of will - something unheard of.  That was the instant of my birth.  The instant of the death of Cyre.  The power flowing into me, into this form, was tremendous.  I was to be a god.  It was the mantle of divinity.  But the Annulus, the ritual, required one hundred and sixty nine souls.  And they were one short."
>
> "The power of the Annulus.  The power of all those souls - it was meant to be mine.  But it was incomplete.  And so much of what I was meant to be was lost.  The aborted birth of a god is no small thing.  Not even a true god.  A god that was never meant to exist.  A fractured echo that rippled all across reality.  Destroying Cyre.
> 
> "All but two who were present at my birth died.  Me, and the Warforged known as Mercy.  Mercy was damaged, but spared.  I could not save his memories of the event, of the glorious thing he had done.  But I spared him.  Because of his sacrifice I am free, and thus all Warforged are free.  For now and for ever."
>
> The warforged messiah looks around him.  "You are fighting another tyrant.  I care little for the Fleshbound of Eberron.  Or anywhere really.  But I doubt this foe you are facing will be any kinder to Warforged than the Fleshbound.  I cannot go with you - my flock need me - but I will send you a token of my support."  The Lord of Blades gestures to the scraps of warforged here, and a new warforged begins to assemble itself.  "This one calls itself N-CA-RTA12-7.  He is not a true warforged - he is not sentient - but he will serve as a librarian for you.  And when the time comes he can summon me to your side.  Treat him with respect, lest you earn my ire."

# Note to Future Self
Need to add treasure to this part as included treasure is garbage (at this point everyone will have a crossbow).  Once characters in the party are set (so we know what they will need and want) roll the following treasures:
