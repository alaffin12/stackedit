### Tser Pool Camp (Area G)
> The road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons.  
>
> The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river.

> The upbeat strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad Vistani - tabaxi - around a bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forestâ€™s edge.

There is little for the players to do here, but if they sit by the campfire they will opportunities to talk to the Vistani and find out about the world they are trapped in.  The Vistani know the following:
* Strahd is a powerful ruler, a god-king of sorts.  However he draws his power from someone or something else.  
* Vistani are not free, per se, but they have some liberty owing to some ancient agreement between the Vistani and Strahd when he was a mortal.  The Vistani are allowed to travel to and from Barovia, although they can never leave it behind forever.  
* The people of Barovia hate the Vistani for this freedom.  That is why Vistani mostly keep to themselves and stay out of the towns.
* There is a repository of ancient knowledge away to the south, near the snowy and shadowed peak of the Father of Storms, which Barovians call Mount Ghakis.  It is a forbidden place for the Vistani, but One of Life might know more.

If the players seek the Fortune Teller/Vistani Elder One of Life she will peer into their future:
* The party are, like the Vistani, not true prisoners of Ravenloft and the Dark Powers.  They are not part of it's endless cycle of forgotten hopes and shattered dreams.  Strahd keeps them here though, which is not much different
* The knowledge the party seeks is forbidden to the Vistani, part of their pact with Strahd.  It lies away to the south, in a place that is older than Strahd.  He went there one time - that is how he became ruler of the land, how he became imprisoned here.  The Vistani do not know more of what they might find there, but the path is straight - along the Svalich Road to Raven River, then south into the Tsolenka Pass.  Then climb the mountain road, to the Father of Storms, and to the knowledge they seek.
* One of Life will then offer to read the fortunes of the party.  Make up something for the party based on their histories and their path (Athas, Krynn, Oerth, Hell, Final Battles).  Then...

> As One of Life surveys the tarot a fearful look crosses her face.  "No... no this cannot be.  This is Strahd's domain!  It is... it is him!"

One of Life will panic, and if they party steps outside they will find the encampment under attack by servants of Vecna - 1 x Necromancer, 1 x Flind, 2 x Ogre Zombies, 4 x Gnoll Pack Lord.  Add others (low level gnolls and zombies) to deal with the Vistani, who are clearly not capable of fighting off this attack.  The party may try and save the Vistani, they may flee - let them make choices.  The aftermath will be bloody, however...
