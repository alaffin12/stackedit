### Vallaki
#### Approaching the Town
>The Old Svalich Road meanders around the valley here, watched over by dark brooding mountains to the north and south.  The choking woods of the valley recede, revealing a sullen burg surrounded by a wooden palisade.  The thick fog of the valley presses against this wall, as if looking for a way inside - to catch the town aslumber.

As the party approaches the gate they will notice several eyes - and crossbows - trained on them.  One of the guards - armed with a pike - will step forward.

> "Halt and state your business here, or be gone..."

The question is simple.  Assuming the party responds with something that is straightforward enough the guard will not deny them admittance.

> "Very well.  You may enter the city.  As you are not from Vallaki, I will advise you of some important laws of the city.  The first - any mention of Strahd is strictly prohibited.  Know that even now as I say the name it is the last time you will hear it within these gates.  If you must mention that individual you are to refer to him simply as the Devil. "
>
> "The second - this noble town holds a weekly festival in honour of the resident's general merriment and the continued support of the burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich.  As guests of Vallaki, you will not be required to aid in the preparation for our festivals. However, your attendance and participation in each and every festival is absolutely mandatory for the length of your stay. Failure to attend will be in strict opposition to Vallakian law. The next great Vallakian festival, the Festival of the Blazing Sun, will be held tomorrow in the town square."
> 
> "The third - the high morale of this town is the source of its ability to stand up to the Devil.  While we understand you might not always feel in the best of spirits - especially as you come from beyond this safe and joyous place and will have to return to your home in time - it is best to hide those emotions away, lest they spread to others.  Harming the morale of the residents is considered a crime, and the punishment can be severe."
> 
> "Failure to comply with Vallakian Law will mark you as criminals in our city, and you will be punished in accordance with our justice system.  If you have any questions now is the time to ask them."

If the players have questions the guards possess the following information:
* On the laws of Vallaki: The guards will reiterate the law as many times as the players require.  If asked about their seemingly extreme nature they will say the festivals and the warm hearts of Vallaki have kept the devil at bay for more than a hundred years.  
* On the possible punishments: They range from fines and imprisonment to exile and to execution in some cases.  There is also a possibility of torture as the burgomaster is a sadist, but they do not mention that.
* On the festivals: The guards will expound their virtues, again reiterating the fact that the morale of the people has kept the people of Vallaki safe for a century.
* On where to stay: The Blue Water Inn is the only inn in town.
* On where to buy gear: Dragomir Ulbrek runs a smithy in town; the Henrik van der Voort, the coffin maker, is the town's best carpenter; Fatima Lukresh runs the tannery; the Alastroi siblings run Endless Delights Clothiers and Gadof Blinsky's for toys.

Once the players confirm they have no more questions the guards will call for a scribe and take a brief description of the party, along with their weapons.  Vallaki does not require visitors to go unarmed (after all, Barovia is a rough place) and they won't even get too mad if people try to lie or hide things (after all, Barovia is the kind of place that inspires paranoia) (DC 12 check to hide items, use false names etc).  

#### Around Town
##### General
The plan is for the players to pick up some cold weather gear to head into the mountains (remind them, if they haven't figured this out yet) and spend a couple evenings in town before heading out.  Refer to this [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8oj1qt/shops_in_vallaki/) for more information on the shops.  This can go lots of ways, but try to follow this basic outline - the players enter the town, get watched by Ernst Lanark, go to Endless Delights, get told to come back in two days (after the festival), go to the inn, get an invite by Lady Wachter, go to the festival the next day, get involved in the riot (maybe), fallout from riot/uprising, get clothes, continue on their path.

##### Being Watched
Shortly after entering town anyone with a passive perception of 14 or more will notice they are being watched by a pale, thin man with a hawkish nose and slicked back hair.  This is Lady Wachter's spy Ernst Lanark.  If confronted Lanark claims he keeps a watchful eye on all strangers.  If they threaten him he will back off, but he will not tell them anything about his purpose.  Once the party decide to leave him alone he will report back to Lady Wachter (they might follow him to find this out).

##### Endless Delights
Upon entering endless delights they will see the Alastroi siblings (Alek, Andrej, and Alana) hard at work - making things for tomorrow's festival.  They seem very busy, and if the party talks to them they might find out that the siblings are ecstatic about the constant festivals, since it keeps their pockets lined with gold.  If they party asks for winter gear the siblings will say they can get it for them - but they will have to wait until after the festival.

##### Blue Water Inn
The only inn in town, during the day only Urwin or his wife Danika are here.  During the evening there are other NPCs.  For their descriptions see below.  At some point during the day (assuming Ernst made is back to Lady Wachter) the party will get an invitation to attend a supper with Lady Wachter that evening.

Rooms cost five silver a night.  The inn also has food and drink available:

**NPCs**
*The Martikovs*: Urwin and his wife Danika are the owners of the Inn and are usually seen splitting their time between the tavern area and the kitchen.  Their young sons Brom and Bray are also often present.  Urwin can be prickly and difficult to deal with.  Danika is more friendly, but she still has a proud and noble bearing and does not suffer fools.  The two boys are 11 and 9 and are typical boys of that age (except that all are wereravens and Urwin and Danika are members of the Keepers of the Feather).

*The Hunters*: Szoldar Szoldarovich and Yevgeni Krushkin are two grim and dour hunters who frequent the tavern.  They don't have much to say and tend to keep to themselves.  If asked they will happily guide the party to the Amber Temple - so long as they pay them 500 gp apiece.  Half upfront.  No haggling.  If they want better directions (or some kind of advice) they provide it for drinks.

*The Wachters*: Nikolai and Karl are the sons of Lady Wachter.  They are brash drunkards and always looking for trouble - but they know better than to pick fights with well-armed strangers.  They are not privy to their mother's plans (she doesn't trust them) nor do they attend her dinner.

##### Wachterhaus
For the next step the players are invited to dinner at Wachterhaus by Lady Wachter herself.  As they approach:
> This house seems disgusted with itself.  A slouching roof hangs heavy over furrowed gables, and moss-covered walls sag and bulge under the weight of the vegetation.  As you study the house's sullen countenance you hear the edifice actually groan

The players are welcomed by Lady Wachter's valet Haliq and escorted to the dining room, where they are set a feast.  Ernst Lanark hovers nearby, watching - but clearly not welcome to the feast.  The menu for the feast is:

| Course | Item | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Appetizer | Chard Salad | A salad of roasted chard leaves along with roasted parsnips, onions, and mushrooms. Sprinkled with crumbly Krezk cheese |
| Soup | Black Soup | A sweet and sour soup cooked with blood, vinegar, cherries, and honey. Little dumplings float in the soup. |
| Main | Sausage & Potatoes | Pork sausage with boiled and buttered potatoes, served with sauerkraut. |
| Desert | Svalich Pudding | A rich pudding made from cream, eggs, blackberries, cherries, and blackcurrants. |

Lady Wachter is trying to get the measure of the party.  She is planning a coup d'etat tomorrow at the festival, and she is unsure what the arrival of the party means for those plans - they could be mercenaries hired by the baron to protect him, or they could be passers-by - still dangerous if they draw swords during the conflict.  On the other hand if they could be convinced to side with her...

Things the Lady 'knows'...
* The Baron is not a good man and in his heart he does not truly care for the people of Vallaki.  He is of short temper, and frail ego - burdening the people of the town with his inane laws and freak festivals to prove he is a great and benevolent ruler, while throwing any who speaks but a word of dissent into the stockade - or worse.  
* His henchman Izek is worse - a sadist who loves torturing people.  There are enough people who disappear into the Baron's grasp - into that sadist's grasp - who never return or who return broken body and soul.  I do not know what he does, but it is terrible.
* The baron's son Viktor holds an especially dark place in the Lady's heart.  Once upon a time Viktor and her daughter Stella were betrothed.  But something that boy did to her broke her mind - forcing Lady Wachter to send her beloved Stella to the Abbey of St. Markovia.
* The festivals are pitiful, and the Baron knows - or should know - they are pointless.  Strahd is the sovereign overlord of Barovia and all within it - if he wished to meddle in the affairs of Vallaki he would do so, and no amount of festivals or good vibes would keep him out.  The fact that he does not is evidence that Strahd is more of an absentee landlord than a direct threat to the people of Vallaki.  He has his own plans, his own pursuits - women, mostly, but there is one woman in particular he seeks.  And he can be reasoned with.  The Baron is just a stubborn, hateful fool.

If the party manage to snoop around the house for a bit and subsequently confront her with some or all of her own indiscretions she will be defensive:

 - **The Body of Her Deceased Husband:** "Yes, I keep my husband's body here.  I cannot mourn him properly with the Baron's foolish laws.  And I dare not bury him in secret beyond these walls - I will not allow his corpse to become part of the corruption of this land."
 - **Stella Imprisoned:** "No, I did not send my daughter to the Abbey.  How could I?  Have you heard what happens to people there?  I have heard... rumours.  I could not take a chance with my daughter.  Not... not like that."
 - **Secret Cult:** "What of it?  You think the Baron does not use similar means of gathering his helpers?  It is just a coincidence that his son and his right hand man are the most sadistic bastards in all of Barovia?  Yes, we practice magic.  Maybe you think them dark magics.  Look around you - this is a dark land."

If they get too pushy she will eject them.  If they get REALLY too pushy she will try to have them assassinated.  But ideally she will get them on her side, because the revolution starts tomorrow!

The party might also be inclined to investigate Lady Wachter's claims after dinner.  If they want to, allow them to explore the Baron's mansion (map is available, but try theatre of the mind I guess?)

##### Festival of the Blazing Sun
###### Part I - The Parade
This can go one of two way, depending on the players interactions with Lady Wachter.  If Lady Wachter is confident of the assistance (or at least neutrality) of the party then go the way of the Laughing Guard.  Otherwise go the way of the Consort of Strahd.

*The Laughing Guard*
> Under threatening skies, a parade of unhappy children dressed as flowers and wearing forced smiles trudges through the muddy streets, leading the way for a group of sorry-looking men and women carrying a ten-foot-diameter wicker ball. The burgomaster and his smiling wife, who holds a sad bouquet of wilting flowers, follow the procession on horseback. As weary spectators watch from their stoops, the ball is borne to the town square. There, it is hoisted and hung from a fifteen-foot-high wooden scaffold, and townsfolk take turns splashing it with oil. Before the wicker sun can be set ablaze, the sky tears open in a sudden downpour. "All will be well!" cries the burgomaster as he brandishes a sputtering torch and marches defiantly through the rain toward the wicker ball, only to have his torch go out as he thrusts it into the sphere. 
>
>A singular laugh erupts from the crowd, drawing the burgomaster's fiery gaze as well as gasps from the townsfolk.

The laugh comes from Lars Kjurls, a member of the town militia.  The baron immediately orders Lars arrested for "Spite" and orders the other guards to take him into custody.  However as other guardsmen approach Lars another voice intervenes...

> "No..."
>
> A loud, familiar feminine voice comes from the crowd, slicing through the square like thunder on a storm cloud  "...men and women of the Town Watch, take not one step further toward this man!"  You see Lady Wachter step forward, the crowd parting around her powerful presence, her eyes blazing with cold fire.  
>
>"You dare raise a blade against him—for a laugh? A laugh? And yet you bow to a man who wraps this town in shackles of forced cheer, who hangs ribbons over rot, and dares call it salvation!"
>
>"You are not his dogs! You are the blood of Vallaki—born of hardship, tempered by shadow, proud and unbroken. And yet you march in lockstep for a tyrant who would burn your homes to fuel his next festival!"
>
> You see others, dressed in cloaks similar to that worn by Lady Wachter.  They cheer her words.  And their hands are on their weapons
> 
>  "How many more parades must we endure while the devil laughs from his castle and the Baron plays at being king? How many more ‘joyous proclamations’ while your neighbors disappear in the night?"
>
> "This is not justice. This is not joy. This is a gilded noose! So I say - cut it! Cast down your false Baron and let this town breathe free air again! You’ve lived in fear long enough. Today, Vallaki remembers its spine!"
>
> As the words are spoken the crowd reacts, some cheering in support of the Lady Wachter, others muttering about her impertinence.  As the Baron gestures to the guards to stop her, blades are drawn amongst the crowd too.   

*The Consort of Strahd*
> Under threatening skies, a parade of unhappy children dressed as flowers and wearing forced smiles trudges through the muddy streets, leading the way for a group of sorry-looking men and women carrying a ten-foot-diameter wicker ball. The burgomaster and his smiling wife, who holds a sad bouquet of wilting flowers, follow the procession on horseback. As weary spectators watch from their stoops, the ball is borne to the town square. There, it is hoisted and hung from a fifteen-foot-high wooden scaffold, and townsfolk take turns splashing it with oil. Baron Vargas Vallakovich then steps forward, plunging a torch into the heart of the great sphere, which bursts into flames immediately.  He then turns to the assembled crowd.
>
> "People of Vallaki! Loyal hearts of our shining town! Today, we burn the rot from our midst!"
> 
> Town guards appear from the fringe of the crowd.  Four are carrying large wicker balls.  Others lead prisoners - Lady Wachter, her two sons Nikolai and Karl, and her daughter Stella.  All are brought onto the raised dais next to the Baron.  Lady Wachter, bound and gagged, glares at the Baron - at the crowd - but behind her rage you sense something else.  Panic.  Karl and Nikolai struggle vainly against their bonds.  And the young woman - Stella - wild eyed, like a cornered animal.  Feral.
>
> The Baron gestures to the family as they are forced into the wicker balls.  "Behold the rot that festered in our midst - Lady Fiona Wachter, betrayer of kin, betrayer of joy, and consort of the Devil himself!"
>
> Gasps ripple through the crowd. The Baron paces the stage with wild energy, cloak flaring behind him.
>
> "She spurned our festivals! She mocked your smiles! She schemed in the dark and whispered rebellion while the rest of you worked and worshipped and wore your joy with pride!"
>
> He stops, jabbing a finger toward her cage.
>
> "And what did we find in her house? What secrets behind her locked doors?"
> 
> He leans forward, voice lowering to a scandalized hiss.
>
> "We found the body of her husband - Nikolaj Wachter - dead these three years, still lying in her bed, dressed and perfumed, as though nothing had passed! A corpse! A rotted man kept in mockery of life, tended by a mad daughter and guarded by servants too terrified to speak!"
>
> A murmur of horror surges through the crowd.
>  
>  "Does that sound like a woman of reason? Of virtue? Of Vallaki?"
>   
>   He flings his arm wide, addressing the people with wild, glistening eyes. 
>    
> "No. She is the Devil’s bride, and her children his creatures. And today, by the light of our Festival, we shall cleanse this evil with flame!  Let it be known: in Vallaki, joy is law. And all who defy it shall burn."
>  
> "REJOICE! For all… will… be… well!"
>
> With that final word, the Baron plunges his torch into the wicker prison of Karl Wachter and begins moving up the line - determined to ensure that the Lady Fiona Wachter will see all her family die before she herself is allowed to perish.

In the "Laughing Guard" scenario a riot is starting.  The players may choose to intervene on either side, or simply avoid getting involved at all.  In the "Consort of Strahd" the players will bear witness to a violent, brutal execution of a family who (for the most part) have done nothing wrong.  Players may choose to intervene (leading to a riot) or may choose to avoid getting involved at all.  Let is all play out - the winning side depends on the players, but if the players don't get involved then it depends on the start:

*If the players side with Lady Wachter, or if the start is the "Laughing Guard" scenario and they do not choose a side:*
* Vargas Vallakovich is killed.  Lady Wachter wants a public execution, but she won't take a chance on him escaping.  
* Lydia Vallakovich is the sister of the priest at St. Andral's.  Lady Wachter is in a bind with her, as keeping her on hand would allow her to control the church.  If she can be captured alive she will be imprisoned in the Burgomaster's Mansion - her former home - to be used as leverage.
* Lady Wachter blames Vicktor Vallakovich for her daughter Stella's condition (in truth is was Izek who tortured her to the point of breaking her mind after she caught Viktor trying to wield powerful infernal magics similar to the the ones Lady Wachter uses, but Lady Wachter does not know or care about this).  Fortunately Viktor knows a bit of magic and manages to escape, teleporting away to be not seen again.
* Lady Wachter would like to feed Izek Strazni to the crows.  After she will raise him back from the dead to be her dedicated brute (although she will not let the people of Vallaki know she is behind his reanimation).
* Riots and revolutions are never fun things.  People will die and the city will burn for more than a week afterwards.  Play this up!

*If the players side with the Baron, or if the start is the "Consort of Strahd" scenario and they do not choose a side:*
* Lady Wachter and her family are all rounded up and executed very publicly (if they are not executed already).
* Believing Lady Wachter to be the heart of a conspiracy against him (which she is) the Baron will being rounding up people and executing them at random.  One of the Alastroi siblings is amongst the dead, and someone shows up to menace Urwin Martikov, before Urwin points out that his family owns the winery and if they threaten him again the taps will be cut and then the Baron will see what a revolution looks like (also, ravens will be around during this, adding a level of supernatural authority to Urwin's threats).

In either case, I assume the players will be moving on after finally getting their cold weather gear.  They might stick around to be involved, but they do have a job to do...
