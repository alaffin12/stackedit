# The Amber Temple
Finally the party reaches the Amber Temple...

## What's Really Going On Here
This is where the 'secret' of the Demiplanes of Dread comes together.  The Amber Temple of Barovia is not the true Amber Temple.  The Amber Temple (or whatever it might be called) is actually the structure of the Demiplanes of Dread themselves - the prison in which the Dark Powers are bound.  The nature of this prison is such that it manifests itself physically in the every domain of Ravenloft.  Each 'Amber Temple' is slightly different - built upon a foundation of the paired Dread Lords own fears, regrets and obsessions - but each is the essence of Ravenloft made manifest. 

**The Path From Here:** The party will have to do the following to move on from here:
* Discover the nature of the Temple, the nature of the Dark Powers so that they can use it to secure the cosmos against Vecna's ritual (if the players fail this Kas can be used to provide this information).  They may also realize that Vecna has liberated one of the Dark Powers, but that is mostly flavour text.
* Convince at least one of the Vestiges in the Amber Temple (shards of the Dark Powers) that they should be let go.  Bonus points if they convince the Dark Powers to let them free Kas to go with them.  
* Strike a bargain (no matter how convincing the party is, they will have to strike a bargain to gain the assistance of the Dark Powers).

## Areas
### General
The Amber Temple is a shadowy reflection of a metaphysical concept - the true prison of the Dark Powers.  Light sources are only half as effective here as normal and dark vision only extends out to 20 ft.  Remember this imposes disadvantage on skill checks relying on vision and imposes a -5 to passive perception.

### X1. Exterior
> As you wind your way through the snow-choked mountain path, the cold intensifies - not just in temperature, but in presence. The wind here doesn't whistle or howl; it whispers, low and guttural, threading through the stones like the breath of something ancient.
>
> And then you see it.
>
> Carved directly into the mountainside, a black shape looms from the cliff face: the Amber Temple. A staircase of cracked stone leads down into a wide courtyard before its entrance—yet the structure beyond seems wrong against the pale white snow. Where the sun strikes the mountains, the temple drinks in the light and offers nothing back. Its massive amber columns, once gilded by age and grandeur, now seem to bleed shadow. Not even the reflected gleam of snow touches its surface.
> 
> For those with dark vision, the shadows still cling—thicker than they should be, heavier somehow, as if the darkness itself resents being seen. Edges blur. Shapes shift at the corners of your vision. The great bronze doors ahead are shut tight, flanked by still guardian statues half-buried in drifting snow, their eyes dark hollows that seem to follow your approach.
> 
> The very air near the temple feels different - denser - like the atmosphere just before a storm, or a breath held far too long. Something waits inside.
>
>And it knows you're coming.
>
> Your eyes flick to the guardian statues, and you get a sense that each is watching you in some way.  Each is carved from a black stone that was ancient when the world was new and each figure it different.  The first (on the left) is a hooded figure, with arms crossed in front of a hollow chest.  Its face is hidden in the shadows of its cloak, it's features worn smooth as if by the weeping of countless tears by infinite mourners.  On the base is inscribed the words *'The Weight of Promises Kept'*
>
> The second statue is a naked, half-human, half-snake figure - blindfolded and smiling.  One hand cradles a book made from bone.  The other is dipped in molten gold - as though caught mid-offering.  Beneath it are the words *'The Price of Knowing'*
> 
> The third statue is a warrior.  He stands, his blade cracked, his head held high and haughty - not in triumph, but in justification.  His brows furrowed,  his lips curled in denial, as if whispering 'I had no choice'.  You notice he looks a bit like Strahd von Zarovich, but the similarity is ephemeral.  In his off hand he holds a crown that weighs upon him.  Beneath him are the words *'The Betrayer Crowned'*
> 
>  The fourth statue kneels in its alcove - robed and pierced through the back with multiple blades - not metal or even stone, but formed from amber and shadow.  Their head is bowed, their face is cracked like porcelain - leaking a faint, golden light from within.  This too bears an ephemeral resemblance to Strahd, but in this case it is a younger version of him.  His hands are open in confusion.  Beneath it are the words *'The Knife's Other Edge'*
>  
>  The fifth statue is that of a gaunt scholar, faceless except for a gaping hole where the left eye would be on a man.  He wears a crown of thorns carved with runes.  It is missing it's right arm, cut off at the elbow.  The left hand is open - in benediction or command.  Behind his hooded head a serpent coils.   Beneath him is carved the words *'The One Who Escaped'*.  
>  
>  The final statue is odd.  It stands, nondescript, simply standing at rest with its head lowered.  When you look up you see why - the stone here has been polished to a mirror like finish and inlaid with amber and silver.  In the statue you can see your own face reflected back at you - but it is not as simple as that, for the amber and silver cause the image to shift and change - as though you are being judged and measured.  Beneath it are the words *'The Sixth is Always Becoming'*.
>
> Upon inspecting the last statue you hear words echo in your head: *"Will you become what we were?  Or what broke us?"*  As if on cue - as if it were a living, breathing thing - you hear the temple rumble and the main door opens slowly.

Each of the statues represents a part of the 'Amber Temple'.  The first statue represents the Bound Warden - the first of the so-called Dark Powers.  An ancient primordial being, the Bound Warden became aware of the damage he had caused to the cosmos and so he transformed himself into a prison, both for himself for others like him.

The second statue represents the Dark Powers themselves.  Not any individual one, mind you, but all of them.  They tempt - with forbidden knowledge (the book) and with wealth and power (the hand) but there is a price for everything.

The third statue is the betrayer.  This represents the Dread Lords, who are something of a fail safe within the system.  Each Dread Lord is a traitor somehow - Strahd von Zarovich betrayed his brother Sergei; Kas betrayed his master Vecna; Vecna betrayed the Amber Temple itself by freeing the Serpent.  Betrayal binds the Dread Lord to Ravenloft and in doing so binds the Dark Powers tighter.

The fourth statue represents the opposite of the third.  It is the betrayed - a necessary part of the prison.  

The fifth statue represents Vecna.  The first - and so far only being - to escape Ravenloft.  Ravenloft - the Amber Temple - fears Vecna because of this.  He has left his imprint on the Demiplanes and so the Demiplanes reflect him.  He is a wound in the cycle of betrayal.  

The sixth statue represents the players.  One of them will have to sacrifice something to free themselves and Kas.  Or perhaps they will break the cycle forevermore in their rush to defeat Vecna.  After all - they had no choice.

#### X1a. Fissure in the Rock
The Amber Temple has been damaged by Vecna's escape.  In doing so an inner room has been opened to the outside.  If the party explores over here tell them that they can hear noises coming from the fissure here, but nothing else.

#### X2. Staircase Mural
> Icy steps descend into the temple, surrounded by frescoes from an ancient time.  This passage is a triptych - a story in three parts.  It features three figures - a humanoid, kneeling before a fire; a being of power, a shadow crowned with antler and fire, and a cluster of other shadows.  The humanoid is bowing - making an offering at the fire.  The crowned figure holds a sword of Amber and Shadow - presenting it to the kneeling humanoid.  The other shadows seem to be connected to the crowned figure, bound to him the way a puppeteer is bound to his marionette.
> 
> The second image is of a tower, high above the clouds, wreathed in lightning.  Below the tower you see many robed figures - reaching for it.  You recognize some of the figures - Strahd is there, as is Vecna - his hand and his eye have been violently gouged out by someone or something.  They all hold amber and shadow swords aloft, pointed towards the tower.  As they reach for the tower you notice that all the figures are bound, held by chains of light that snake into the depths of the earth.   
> 
> The third image, as you descend the staircase, is of a shattered mirror of amber and silver.  Vecna, his chains shattered, stands over it, holding an amber and shadow sword  - his hand and eye once more rudely gouged from the rock.  You count twenty fragments before you see the last one, almost hidden behind the image of Vecna, shaped like a serpent.

This triptych tells the story of Ravenloft.  The first image represents the bargain - all bargains - that are struck by the Dark Powers.  And offering of fire for a sword (a symbol of power) while shadowy figured lurk in the background, manipulating the event.  The second image represents the nature of the Dread Lords.  They carry the sword from the first image.  They also see familiar Dread Lords in the image - Strahd and Vecna.  The third image represents Vecna's escape.  The vestiges imprisoned in the Dark Tower are facets of something greater.  One of the facets - shaped like a Serpent - has escaped with Vecna.


##### X2a & X2b.  Guard Rooms
Nothing much interesting here.  These were guard rooms, with murder holes that looked down on the entrance.  In room X2b there is a skeleton dressed in wizard's robes - the remains of someone who visited the temple in ages past.  They wear a set of Eyes of Minute Seeing.

#### X3. Barracks
Once these rooms houses the temples defenders.  Now only scattered bits of wood remain.  A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the presence of something off in these rooms - secret doors to X2a and X2b which can be uncovered with a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigate) check.

#### X4. Overlook
> A twenty-foot-wide balcony of black marble with a shattered railing overlooks a vast temple. Black marble staircases at each end of the balcony descend into the gloomy shadows below, and the walls reach towards a ceiling that is equally shrouded.  The walls here are covered in
an amber glaze, lending the gloom a golden sheen.  
>
> Behind you there is a massive mural.  On the left (east) side it depicts a long caravan of pilgrims ascending the mountainside in deep winter, bearing torches and relics.  The torches are almost real, and seem like they should be emitting light, but no light comes from them.  The faces of the pilgrims are sombre.  Some seem hopeful while other seem afraid.  At the peak stands a vast and dark temple, and a statue of a one-eyed, one-handed figure looks before it.
> 
> On the right side the same temple is in ruins, and amber has burst from the earth - consuming part of the structure.  The figures who were pilgrims are now faceless statues, scattered across a wide cavern.  Their torches still burn with no light.
> 
>  On the floor you find a small inscription.  It reads: *'They came to bind the gods.  They found only their reflections.'*
>
> A pair of amber doors stands closed at the west end of the balcony.  A similar pair stands open to the east.

The is the story of the founding of the Amber Temple - or rather this version of the Amber Temple.  In short it was already there when its creators arrived - hinting at the ancient, history defying nature of the place.  If players look closely at the mural they might notice their own faces in among the other pilgrims - after all, they are seeing the same as those first pilgrims.  

A player studying the mural will find a hidden detail - a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigate) check reveals that there is a trail of amber inlaid into the mural, tracing a path through each pilgrim's torch.  A Wisdom (Insight) of 15 check reveals that this path of amber could represent the path walked by the pilgrims themselves - a path of choice, of transformation and corruption.  If they rolled 20 or higher they also come to understand that the line of amber becomes purer the closer it gets to the heart of the pattern, as if to indicate that the path refines or purifies those who walk it.  A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the path actually echoes an arcane Mark of Binding - rare magic used to trap powerful entities.  If they rolled a 20 or higher they realize that the sigil is not just a binder - it is a filter - designed to separate fragments of the self as they travel upon it - shedding pieces of what they are until the finished product is ready.

#### X5. Temple of Lost Secrets
> The hall opens into a vault of silence and shadow. Four immense black pillars rise toward a ceiling lost in gloom, their surfaces glistening faintly with frost and old amber resin. At the far end looms the statue, a massive, seated figure carved of seamless amber, faceless and featureless but bearing a hollow chest and arms cross before it - the same as the first statue outside the temple.
> 
>  Veins of black crystal spread like rot from the statue’s heart, radiating through amber flesh like old fractures. A jagged split runs from its hollow chest up to the space where its right eye should be.  Another from the chest to the statue's left hand. Within that fissure, darkness pulses faintly, and if one looks too long, they see flickers of movement — as if something were watching from inside.

This statue represents the Warden - the being that is the root of the Demiplanes of Dread.  The wound represents Vecna's escape.  The black crystal contains two Wounds of Silence - aberrations born from the damage done by Vecna.  They will attack the players if they get close to the statue.  When each of the Wounds is destroyed they leave behind two Shards of Silence.

To the north of the statue there is a hidden door.  Players with a passive perception of 15 (or who make a DC Wisdom (Perception) check while investigating the room) notice something strange about the wall.  A DC 20 Intelligence (Investigate) Check reveals the presence of a seam in the amber which marks the frame of a hidden door.  The door is sealed with an arcane lock spell, but players can try to find their way through the hidden entrance.

##### X5d. Amber Reflections
As the party passes beneath this arch they see themselves mirrored in the amber.  However their reflections aren't true reflections, but rather twisted by this place.

If there are party members that seem to identify with the reflections shown below (roles in the Amber Temple cycle) then assign them based on that.  Otherwise assign at random:

| Role | Vision | Words |
| -- | -- | -- |
| The Warden | The player sees themselves dressed in robes, at the centre of the circle of chains.  But the chains don't bind him - they come from him. | "He watched too long, he listened too well." |
| The Temptation | The player sees themselves as a pale figure, holding out a crown to a robed figure.  | "Power was the promise, silence was the cost." |
| The Betrayer | The player sees themselves plunging an amber and shadow sword into a figure hidden in shadows.  They are weeping as they do so - an act of pain, not hatred. | "He who ends the tyrant becomes the tyrant" |
| The Betrayed | The player sees themselves slain by an amber and shadow sword, held by a mysterious figure in the shadow.  | "All that he was became what we are." 
| The One That Escaped *(if someone is using the Eye of Vecna they become this one)* | The player sees themselves as a figure fleeing into a flaw in the amber, chains left behind.  A serpentine shadow follows them. | "We were not meant to be free, but one was" |
| The One Yet to Come | The player sees nothing in the mirror. | "The cycle must have a shape.  Will you be its end, or its centre?" |

If the party chooses to further interact with the mirror they will be granted shards of prophetic visions:

| Roll | Vision |
| -- | -- |
| 1 | You see Vecna
