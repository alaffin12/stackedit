# The Amber Temple
Finally the party reaches the Amber Temple...

## What's Really Going On Here
This is where the 'secret' of the Demiplanes of Dread comes together.  The Amber Temple of Barovia is not the true Amber Temple.  The Amber Temple (or whatever it might be called) is actually the structure of the Demiplanes of Dread themselves - the prison in which the Dark Powers are bound.  The nature of this prison is such that it manifests itself physically in the every domain of Ravenloft.  Each 'Amber Temple' is slightly different - built upon a foundation of the paired Dread Lords own fears, regrets and obsessions - but each is the essence of Ravenloft made manifest. 

**The Path From Here:** The party will have to do the following to move on from here:
* Discover the nature of the Temple, the nature of the Dark Powers so that they can use it to secure the cosmos against Vecna's ritual (if the players fail this Kas can be used to provide this information).  They may also realize that Vecna has liberated one of the Dark Powers, but that is mostly flavour text.
* Convince at least one of the Vestiges in the Amber Temple (shards of the Dark Powers) that they should be let go.  Bonus points if they convince the Dark Powers to let them free Kas to go with them.  
* Strike a bargain (no matter how convincing the party is, they will have to strike a bargain to gain the assistance of the Dark Powers).

## Areas
### General
The Amber Temple is a shadowy reflection of a metaphysical concept - the true prison of the Dark Powers.  Light sources are only half as effective here as normal and dark vision only extends out to 20 ft.  Remember this imposes disadvantage on skill checks relying on vision and imposes a -5 to passive perception.

### X1. Exterior
> As you wind your way through the snow-choked mountain path, the cold intensifies - not just in temperature, but in presence. The wind here doesn't whistle or howl; it whispers, low and guttural, threading through the stones like the breath of something ancient.
>
> And then you see it.
>
> Carved directly into the mountainside, a black shape looms from the cliff face: the Amber Temple. A staircase of cracked stone leads down into a wide courtyard before its entrance—yet the structure beyond seems wrong against the pale white snow. Where the sun strikes the mountains, the temple drinks in the light and offers nothing back. Its massive amber columns, once gilded by age and grandeur, now seem to bleed shadow. Not even the reflected gleam of snow touches its surface.
> 
> For those with dark vision, the shadows still cling—thicker than they should be, heavier somehow, as if the darkness itself resents being seen. Edges blur. Shapes shift at the corners of your vision. The great bronze doors ahead are shut tight, flanked by still guardian statues half-buried in drifting snow, their eyes dark hollows that seem to follow your approach.
> 
> The very air near the temple feels different - denser - like the atmosphere just before a storm, or a breath held far too long. Something waits inside.
>
>And it knows you're coming.
>
> Your eyes flick to the guardian statues, and you get a sense that each is watching you in some way.  Each is carved from a black stone that was ancient when the world was new and each figure it different.  The first (on the left) is a hooded figure, with arms crossed in front of a hollow chest.  Its face is hidden in the shadows of its cloak, it's features worn smooth as if by the weeping of countless tears by infinite mourners.  On the base is inscribed the words *'The Weight of Promises Kept'*
>
> The second statue is a naked, half-human, half-snake figure - blindfolded and smiling.  One hand cradles a book made from bone.  The other is dipped in molten gold - as though caught mid-offering.  Beneath it are the words *'The Price of Knowing'*
> 
> The third statue is a warrior.  He stands, his blade cracked, his head held high and haughty - not in triumph, but in justification.  His brows furrowed,  his lips curled in denial, as if whispering 'I had no choice'.  You notice he looks a bit like Strahd von Zarovich, but the similarity is ephemeral.  In his off hand he holds a crown that weighs upon him.  Beneath him are the words *'The Betrayer Crowned'*
> 
>  The fourth statue kneels in its alcove - robed and pierced through the back with multiple blades - not metal or even stone, but formed from amber and shadow.  Their head is bowed, their face is cracked like porcelain - leaking a faint, golden light from within.  This too bears an ephemeral resemblance to Strahd, but in this case it is a younger version of him.  His hands are open in confusion.  Beneath it are the words *'The Knife's Other Edge'*
>  
>  The fifth statue is that of a gaunt scholar, faceless except for a gaping hole where the left eye would be on a man.  He wears a crown of thorns carved with runes.  It is missing it's left arm, cut off at the elbow.  The right hand is open - in benediction or command.  Behind his hooded head a serpent coils.   Beneath him is carved the words *'The One Who Escaped'*.  
>  
>  The final statue is odd.  It stands, nondescript, simply standing at rest with its head lowered.  When you look up you see why - the stone here has been polished to a mirror like finish and inlaid with amber and silver.  In the statue you can see your own face reflected back at you - but it is not as simple as that, for the amber and silver cause the image to shift and change - as though you are being judged and measured.  Beneath it are the words *'The Sixth is Always Becoming'*.
>
> Upon inspecting the last statue you hear words echo in your head: *"Will you become what we were?  Or what broke us?"*  As if on cue - as if it were a living, breathing thing - you hear the temple rumble and the main door opens slowly.

Each of the statues represents a part of the 'Amber Temple'.  The first statue represents the Bound Warden - the first of the so-called Dark Powers.  An ancient primordial being, the Bound Warden became aware of the damage he had caused to the cosmos and so he transformed himself into a prison, both for himself for others like him.

The second statue represents the Dark Powers themselves.  Not any individual one, mind you, but all of them.  They tempt - with forbidden knowledge (the book) and with wealth and power (the hand) but there is a price for everything.

The third statue is the betrayer.  This represents the Dread Lords, who are something of a fail safe within the system.  Each Dread Lord is a traitor somehow - Strahd von Zarovich betrayed his brother Sergei; Kas betrayed his master Vecna; Vecna betrayed the Amber Temple itself by freeing the Serpent.  Betrayal binds the Dread Lord to Ravenloft and in doing so binds the Dark Powers tighter.

The fourth statue represents the opposite of the third.  It is the betrayed - a necessary part of the prison.  

The fifth statue represents Vecna.  The first - and so far only being - to escape Ravenloft.  Ravenloft - the Amber Temple - fears Vecna because of this.  He has left his imprint on the Demiplanes and so the Demiplanes reflect him.  He is a wound in the cycle of betrayal.  

The sixth statue represents the players.  One of them will have to sacrifice something to free themselves and Kas.  Or perhaps they will break the cycle forevermore in their rush to defeat Vecna.  After all - they had no choice.

#### X1a. Fissure in the Rock
The Amber Temple has been damaged by Vecna's escape.  In doing so an inner room has been opened to the outside.  If the party explores over here tell them that they can hear noises - like those of a wind storm - coming from the fissure here, but nothing else.

#### X2. Staircase Mural
> Icy steps descend into the temple, surrounded by frescoes from an ancient time.  This passage is a triptych - a story in three parts.  It features three figures - a humanoid, kneeling before a fire; a being of power, a shadow crowned with antler and fire, and a cluster of other shadows.  The humanoid is bowing - making an offering at the fire.  The crowned figure holds a sword of Amber and Shadow - presenting it to the kneeling humanoid.  The other shadows seem to be connected to the crowned figure, bound to him the way a puppeteer is bound to his marionette.
> 
> The second image is of a tower, high above the clouds, wreathed in lightning.  Below the tower you see many robed figures - reaching for it.  You recognize some of the figures - Strahd is there, as is Vecna - his hand and his eye have been violently gouged out by someone or something.  They all hold amber and shadow swords aloft, pointed towards the tower.  As they reach for the tower you notice that all the figures are bound, held by chains of light that snake into the depths of the earth.   
> 
> The third image, as you descend the staircase, is of a shattered mirror of amber and silver.  Vecna, his chains shattered, stands over it, holding an amber and shadow sword  - his hand and eye once more rudely gouged from the rock.  You count twenty fragments before you see the last one, almost hidden behind the image of Vecna, shaped like a serpent.

This triptych tells the story of Ravenloft.  The first image represents the bargain - all bargains - that are struck by the Dark Powers.  And offering of fire for a sword (a symbol of power) while shadowy figured lurk in the background, manipulating the event.  The second image represents the nature of the Dread Lords.  They carry the sword from the first image.  They also see familiar Dread Lords in the image - Strahd and Vecna.  The third image represents Vecna's escape.  The vestiges imprisoned in the Dark Tower are facets of something greater.  One of the facets - shaped like a Serpent - has escaped with Vecna.


##### X2a & X2b.  Guard Rooms
Nothing much interesting here.  These were guard rooms, with murder holes that looked down on the entrance.  In room X2b there is a skeleton dressed in wizard's robes - the remains of someone who visited the temple in ages past.  They wear a set of Eyes of Minute Seeing.

#### X3. Barracks
Once these rooms houses the temples defenders.  Now only scattered bits of wood remain.  A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the presence of something off in these rooms - secret doors to X2a and X2b which can be uncovered with a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigate) check.

#### X4. Overlook
> A twenty-foot-wide balcony of black marble with a shattered railing overlooks a vast temple. Black marble staircases at each end of the balcony descend into the gloomy shadows below, and the walls reach towards a ceiling that is equally shrouded.  The walls here are covered in an amber glaze, lending the gloom a golden sheen.  
>
> Behind you there is a massive mural.  On the left (east) side it depicts a long caravan of pilgrims ascending the mountainside in deep winter, bearing torches and relics.  The torches are almost real, and seem like they should be emitting light, but no light comes from them.  The faces of the pilgrims are sombre.  Some seem hopeful while other seem afraid.  At the peak stands a vast and dark temple, and a statue of a one-eyed, one-handed figure looks before it.
> 
> On the right side the same temple is in ruins, and amber has burst from the earth - consuming part of the structure.  The figures who were pilgrims are now faceless statues, scattered across a wide cavern.  Their torches still burn with no light.
> 
>  On the floor you find a small inscription.  It reads: *'They came to bind the gods.  They found only their reflections.'*
>
> A pair of amber doors stands closed at the west end of the balcony.  A similar pair stands open to the east.

The is the story of the founding of the Amber Temple - or rather this version of the Amber Temple.  In short it was already there when its creators arrived - hinting at the ancient, history defying nature of the place.  If players look closely at the mural they might notice their own faces in among the other pilgrims - after all, they are seeing the same as those first pilgrims.  

A player studying the mural will find a hidden detail - a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigate) check reveals that there is a trail of amber inlaid into the mural, tracing a path through each pilgrim's torch.  A Wisdom (Insight) of 15 check reveals that this path of amber could represent the path walked by the pilgrims themselves - a path of choice, of transformation and corruption.  If they rolled 20 or higher they also come to understand that the line of amber becomes purer the closer it gets to the heart of the pattern, as if to indicate that the path refines or purifies those who walk it.  A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the path actually echoes an arcane Mark of Binding - rare magic used to trap powerful entities.  If they rolled a 20 or higher they realize that the sigil is not just a binder - it is a filter - designed to separate fragments of the self as they travel upon it - shedding pieces of what they are until the finished product is ready.

#### X5. Temple of Lost Secrets
> The hall opens into a vault of silence and shadow. Four immense black pillars rise toward a ceiling lost in gloom, their surfaces glistening faintly with frost and old amber resin. At the far end looms the statue, a massive, seated figure carved of seamless amber, faceless and featureless but bearing a hollow chest and arms cross before it - the same as the first statue outside the temple.
> 
>  Veins of black crystal spread like rot from the statue’s heart, radiating through amber flesh like old fractures. A jagged split runs from its hollow chest up to the space where its left eye should be.  Another from the chest to the statue's left hand. Within that fissure, darkness pulses faintly, and if one looks too long, they see flickers of movement — as if something were watching from inside.

This statue represents the Warden - the being that is the root of the Demiplanes of Dread.  The wound represents Vecna's escape.  The black crystal contains two Wounds of Silence - aberrations born from the damage done by Vecna.  They will attack the players if they get close to the statue.  When each of the Wounds is destroyed they leave behind two Shards of Silence.

To the north of the statue there is a hidden door.  Players with a passive perception of 15 (or who make a DC Wisdom (Perception) check while investigating the room) notice something strange about the wall.  A DC 20 Intelligence (Investigate) Check reveals the presence of a seam in the amber which marks the frame of a hidden door.  The door is sealed with an arcane lock spell, but players can try to find their way through the hidden entrance.

The three other statues in alcoves here (there was a fourth, but it has been destroyed) are carved from marble, and seem to represent different figures.  If the players investigate them they will find the following:

| Position | Appearance | Inscription |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Top Left | A tall, skeletal figure in scholar’s robes, arms outstretched and mouth wide in a soundless scream. Its amber eyes are hollowed, its fingers clawed as if they tried to scratch through reality. | “I beheld the coil unbound, and the mouth that would not close. I begged them to turn away. They did not.” |
| Bottom Left | A veiled figure kneeling, with a shattered lantern resting in their lap. The robes are carved to suggest movement against an unseen wind. Their head is bowed in grief. | “I walked into the dark that others would not, and spoke what I found. They called it heresy. But the dark speaks still.” |
| Bottom Right | A knight in heavy, cracked plate, bowed beneath massive amber chains. Their face is hidden beneath a cracked helm, but their back is straight with resolve. | “I begged them not to forge the cage with his wisdom. His chains are never yours — only his.” |
| Top Right | Rubble | "...a wound cannot guard itself..." |

##### X5d. Amber Reflections
As the party passes beneath this arch they see themselves mirrored in the amber.  However their reflections aren't true reflections, but rather twisted by this place.  If there are party members that seem to identify with the reflections shown below (roles in the Amber Temple cycle - for example anyone who is attuned to the Eye of Vecna will present as the 'One Who Escaped') then assign them based on that.  Otherwise assign at random:

| Role | Vision | Words |
| -- | -- | -- |
| The Warden | The player sees themselves dressed in robes, at the centre of the circle of chains.  But the chains don't bind him - they come from him. | "He watched too long, he listened too well." |
| The Temptation | The player sees themselves as a pale figure, holding out a crown to a robed figure.  | "Power was the promise, silence was the cost." |
| The Betrayer | The player sees themselves plunging an amber and shadow sword into a figure hidden in shadows.  They are weeping as they do so - an act of pain, not hatred. | "He who ends the tyrant becomes the tyrant" |
| The Betrayed | The player sees themselves slain by an amber and shadow sword, held by a mysterious figure in the shadow.  | "All that he was became what we are." 
| The One That Escaped | The player sees themselves as a figure fleeing into a flaw in the amber, chains left behind.  A serpentine shadow follows them. | "We were not meant to be free, but one was" |
| The One Yet to Come | The player sees nothing in the mirror. | "The cycle must have a shape.  Will you be its end, or its centre?" |

If the party chooses to further interact with the mirror they will be granted shards of prophetic visions:

| Roll | Vision |
| -- | -- |
| 1 | You see Vecna being slain by someone - another image you have seen scattered around this place.  The other is slaying Vecna, but Vecna holds the blade too.  A mirror cracks. |
| 2 | You see an image similar to the first of the triptych on the stairway.  In this version the humanoid is offering his eye and hand to the antlered king. |
| 3 | You see yourself holding a crown.  Tears are streaming from your face.  You do not want it. |
| 4 | You see countless replicas of this temple, scattered across many realms.  Each temple forms a link in a chain. |
| 5 | You see a great geometric gear with six figures standing on it.  Every moment the gear rotates, as if part of some greater machine.  Five of the figures remain the same, but one figure changes with every movement.  The last figure you see in that place is you. |
| 6 | You see a serpent, bound by chains held by an unseen figure.  The chain snaps, the tension causing it to whip back towards the one holding the chain.  You hear a cry of primordial pain. |
| 7 | You see a name etched on the link of a chain, written in a language you cannot decipher.  The name fades from view. |
| 8 | You see the statues from outside the temple.  You hear a voice: "the sixth was not meant to be.  They exist because the mirror cracked." |
| 9 | You see an empty throne.  And yet someone sits in it. |
| 10 | You hear a voice "The one yet to come has broken the chain.  Will the one yet to come forge it anew?  Or sunder it again? |

##### Developments
If the players visit the statue again after making contact with the vestiges but not having taken the offer the statue - or the Spirit of the Warden, more properly - will make them an offer.

> As you look once more on the massive statue you see the veins of black crystal pulse with a sickly, pale light.  You feel the weight of something - powerful, otherworldly - weighing upon you.  It's crushing, like being at the bottom of an ocean, squeezing you. Making it hard to breathe. And then you hear a voice. It's voice.
>
> *"You have walked the halls of memory. You have glimpsed the pattern, the cycle. Creation, betrayal, vengeance, silence. You know now what it means to be bound, and what it costs to be free. I am the Warden. Not by choice. Never by choice. The chain is broken. A place is empty. The cycle cannot turn until the wound is sealed."*
> 
> *That which is bound here stirs at your coming. It offers freedom - yes. And power. It will give you a betrayer, and turn him loose upon your enemies. But you know what that cost will be. It is always paid in time."*
>
> *"Or..."*
>
> The statue's eyes flare, and for a moment, the room is dead silent except for your own heartbeat.
>
> *"One of you may take his place. One of you may restore what was lost, seal the wound, reforge the cycle. The chain will bind again. The Temple will endure. The dread shall not spill outward. Your allies will be free to go, for they have learned the secret knowledge you have sought.  But you will not leave.  Your name will be forgotten. Your story unspoken. Your sacrifice unseen by any who matter. Except us. The few who remain."*
>
> *"Choose, O mortals. Freedom... or duty. Collapse... or burden. The cycle... or the end of it."*

#### X6. Southeast Annex
> This room is featureless except for a circular stone carving  to the east.  It looks, perhaps, like it might have once been a fountain of some sort, but now it lies dry and lifeless.  Empty torch sconces along the walls. Double doors of amber stand open to the north and west. A single closed door lies just south of the western set of double doors.

The secret doorway on the southern wall can be noticed by a 15 Passive Perception or a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check while looking.  A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigate) check will reveal the door to the party.

#### X7. East Scroll Repository
> Carved into the south wall of this dusty space are cylindrical holes fit for scrolls or maps.

If the players search for scrolls they find most of them having turned to dust over the centuries.  They do find a fragment of an old scroll, however:

> “The Temple is a prison. Always, there are four: the Warden who binds, the Seducer who hopes, the Betrayer who shatters, and the Betrayed who bleeds. This is the cycle of chains and choices — ever-turning, self-fed. But now, the cycle is torn. One escaped their place and fled beyond the prison, unmaking the pattern and scarring the Temple’s heart. In the wake of that absence, a shadow stirs — not bound by the old rhythm, but born of its unravelling. One yet to come. One who may restore the chain… or break it forever.” 

#### X8. Upper East Hall
> Glazed amber covers the walls of this twenty-foot-wide, seventy-foot-long arched corridor. The amber doors at both ends of the hall stand open. A closed door is in the middle of the east wall, and three arrow slits are cut into the wall across from it. Cracks in the black marble floor run the length of the hall.

The arrow slits are 5 inches wide, 2.5 feet tall, and 1 foot thick. They look down on the temple (area X5).

#### X9. Lecture Hall
>This chamber is brightly lit by red copper lanterns that l hang from the ceiling. The walls are sheathed in amber that has been shaped into bas-reliefs. Stairs to the north and south descend twenty feet to an obsidian lectern, behind which a slab of black slate hangs from chains. Between the stairs are descending rows of red marble benches.
>>
> The bas-relief is massive.  It stretches from floor to ceiling like a frozen vision.  At its heart hangs a vast eclipse — a terrible eye-shaped sun, veiled in unnatural darkness. From its black corona stream writhing tendrils of amber, rooting downward like burning roots.  Beneath the eclipse lies a scarred landscape: dozens of temples — some domed, some spired, some half-ruined — each carved in a different architectural style, scattered across a featureless plain. The tendrils of the eclipse burrow into them, piercing altar and threshold alike. One temple, half-sundered, bears a faint resemblance this temple.
>
> In the foreground, pilgrims raise torches toward the sky, but their flames are frozen, locked in place. Each pilgrim’s face is turned upward in awe, horror, or devotion — yet all cast no shadows.  Above the eclipse, barely visible without close inspection, floats a figure of light, fractured and contorted. One hand reaches upward, one clutches a torn chain.
>
> As you all enter the room the doors close behind you with a dull thud.  The lights pulse brighter and then dull, shrouding the room in flickering shadows.  A figure fades into view at the lectern - a tall, gaunt humans dressed in ancient robes  You can see a deep, cutting wound in his chest.  A crown of spectral glyphs circle his head.  He extends a hand towards you...
>
> *"Class... reconvenes..."
> >
> The air fractures around his words.

*The Professor* is a manifestation of the Amber Temple, an echo of the cycle made manifest.  He is closely identified with the Warden archetype.  As such it cannot be harmed or impeded in any way.  Attacks against it will be ignored, and attempts to restrain it will be circumvented.  He is not a ghost or a creature of any sort - he is a projection.   

Despite this roll initiative for him.  The professor does not attack directly, but instead simply waits at the lectern and ask questions of his 'students'.  His purpose is to illuminate the nature of the Amber Temple and to guide them.  And the shadows will claim those that do not learn.

Each round, on its initiative, the Professor will ask a question.  Roll 1d6:

##### **1. “Which breaks first: the oath or the heart?”**
*   **Theme**: Sacrifice, duty vs. love
*   **Intent**: Probe what the character values more - their convictions or their emotions.
* **Sample “Successful” Responses:**  “The heart always breaks first. It has to. If the oath breaks first, you were never worthy of it.” “The oath breaks. And it’s not weakness. It’s because the heart learns something the oath never knew.”
* **Weak/Deflective Answers:** “Neither. I’m too strong for that.” “It depends on the situation.”   

##### **2. “What would you give up to save one world? What would you take to save many?”**
* **Theme**: Price of heroism
*  **Intent**: Force players to confront moral ambiguity.
*  **Sample “Successful” Responses:** “I would give my name. My future. I would take the hatred of the ones I save, if it meant they lived.” “I would take power I didn’t want - and become the thing others fear - if it meant my daughter would grow up free.”
* **Weak/Deflective Answers:** “Whatever I need to.” “Nothing. I’d find another way.”

##### **3. “Do you think he escaped? Or was he let go?”**
* **Theme**: Responsibility, guilt, choice
* **Intent**: Test whether they understand the Professor’s own torment - and Vecna’s manipulation.
* **Sample “Successful” Responses:** “He was let go. Not out of mercy - but because those in power chose not to see him for what he was.” “Both. Escape is only possible when someone leaves the door cracked open.”
* **Weak/Deflective Answers:** “He’s just clever.” “Who cares, he’s out now.” 

##### **4. “Who must suffer so that you may win?”**
* **Theme**: Cost of victory
*  **Intent**: Force the party to confront the weight of their quest.
* **Sample “Successful” Responses:**  “My friends. My past. And I know it, and I carry that with me every day.” “The ones who have no voice. And I hate that. But I know that.”
*  **Weak/Deflective Answers:** “No one. I won’t let anyone suffer.” 

##### **5. “If you wore the Betrayer’s crown, would you lie and call it justice?”**
* **Theme**: Hypocrisy, power and narrative
*  **Intent**: Ask whether they believe themselves to be the hero — and what they would do if forced into a villain’s position.
* **Sample “Successful” Responses:** “Yes. Because sometimes the truth would kill more than the lie.” “No. I would wear it and call myself what I am. That’s the price of power.”
* **Weak/Deflective Answers:** “I’d never betray anyone.” “I wouldn’t wear it.”

##### **6. “What secret do you keep from yourself?”**
* **Theme**: Self-deception
* **Intent**: A deeply personal test. Most difficult to answer truthfully.
* **Sample “Successful” Responses:** “That I like the killing.” “That I don’t actually believe I can save anyone. Not really.”
* **Weak/Deflective Answers:** “I don’t have secrets.” “That I could have been better.”

Allow the players to discuss their answers, but only allow one answer per question.  They can also move around as they please on their turn.  If they answer 'incorrectly' then the lights will blaze for a moment, as if crying out in pain, and the professor will chastise them for not understanding it - warning that if they do not understand then they cannot make the choice.  On the other hand if they answer correctly the professor will reward them, saying things like:

* *"So… the wound remembers. You are closer to the crown than you think."*
*  *"That answer cost you something. Good. The temple only opens for the broken."*
*  *"Would that I could forget, as you remember. The shadows are satisfied. Go."*

After the third question, unless the party has answered all three perfectly, the eclipsed sun will pulse and shadows will bleed from the amber, taking shape.  A greater shadow, and overshadow, and a shadow demon will emerge from the walls, roll their initiative and begin to attack the party.  Each round roll a dice and add more shadow monsters (enough to keep the pressure on, but not kill the party).  

Once the party answers three questions correctly the professor and the shadows will depart, allowing the party to examine the bas relief in detail.  A perfunctory examination will allow the players to see themselves in the bas relief - now becoming part of the cycle.  A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigate) check reveals words hidden in the bas relief.  They say "The Light Was Meant to Bind the Lie.  Now the Lie is the Light."

#### X10. Northeast Annex
> The amber walls and ceiling in the eastern portion of this bare stone room have collapsed. To the west and south are open amber doors. In the centre of the room is a humanoid warrior made of cracked amber, its form marred by veins of shadow. It turns to face you and clenches its fists.  *"Unworthy!"*

The shardsaint here attacks the party.  Just a battle - nothing more than that.

#### X11. Northeast Balcony
> This black marble balcony, above - you presume - the floor shrouded in shadows below, overhangs the northeast corner of the temple. The two amber doors leading from this balcony stand open.

#### X12. East Shrine
> This bare stone room consists of a foyer to the west and a shrine to the east. Four candlesticks lie on the dusty floor of the foyer. In the shrine, fragments of a shattered obsidian statue are scattered in a raised alcove at the eastern end of the chamber. Two pairs of empty alcoves line the north and south walls of the shrine.

If the players explore the rubble of the statue they will find two things - a shard of obsidian that looks like the right side of a creatures face and the statues inscription.  The eye in that piece of rubble looks like it was not constructed of obsidian, but amber.  The inscription reads: *"From Within the Prison He Saw Not the Walls, Only the Key"*.

A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigate) check while looking at the eye reveals a curious thing about it.  Inside the amber eyeball one can see a representation of the Amber Temple.  But it, and it's surroundings, seem to shift slightly depending on the angle it is held at.

The secret door in the northern alcove can be detected by searching the room and making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or having a 15 passive perception.  One detected it can be found by a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigate) check.

#### X13. East Archer Post
> This narrow room has an arrow slit in the centre of the south wall.

#### X14. North Staircase
> A dusty corridor heads north, then bends to the east, descending a dark staircase. The air is thin, but heavy with the stench of death.

This stairway descends to area X14a.

##### X14a. 70Collapsed Lower Hall
> The stairs descend to a collapsed hall with a high ceiling and amber-glazed walls glazed. Rubble covers most of the floor, and a path through the rubble leads to an open doorway. A deathly stench seems to come from there.

This space was once part of X32, but damage to the temple has caused it to fall in on itself.  If the players do not douse their lights before entering this areas the creatures in X33c are alerted to their presence.

#### X15. Southwest Annex
Damage to the Amber Temple has left it exposed to the outside world here - a fissure in the wall that can be used to gain access.  In the same way there is a metaphysical crack or fissure here which has allowed powerful outsiders to descend into the Amber Temple - and into the Material Plane of the Demiplanes of Dread.  A Tempest Maw, four Storm Eels and two Gibbering Starspawn have taken up residence here.

The secret door here can be detected by a DC Wisdom (Perception) check of 15 while searching or a passive perception of 15.  It can be located and opened with a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigate) check.

#### X16. West Scroll Repository
> Carved into the south wall of this dusty space are cylindrical holes fit for scrolls or maps.

This is more or less identical to X7.  

In this room the players find a scroll written in an archaic script (requiring a DC 14 Intelligence (Religion or Arcana) check to decipher without magic).  It is incomplete, but the legible portion reads:

*...and so it is that the Temple is not a place but a pattern, cast in shadow and light. As amber holds insects, so too does the Amber Temple contain truths — not one truth, but many. Each Temple reflects a facet of the others across the infinite prism of dread. Where one is opened, the rest shimmer with potential.*

They also find a spell scroll containing the spell Amber Binding:

>**Amber Binding**
>*7th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of acid and a pinch of bone dust)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
**Effect:** Target one enemy.   The target must make a Constitution saving throw or take 10d10 force damage and be bound by the same mystical amber that can be found in the amber temple.  This amber binds them, meaning they cannot teleport, regenerate or otherwise phase out of the current plane of existence for one minute.  It also loses 10 ft of movement from whatever movement types it has while this is in effect.  They may make a future save at the end of each of their subsequent turns to end this effect.  On a success, it takes half-damage and suffers no disruption.

#### X17. Upper West Hall
> The walls of this twenty foot wide, seventy foot long arched corridor are sheathed in amber.  In it you see several figures - humanoid, frozen lifeless in amber, their face a mask of horror and pain.  One of them turns their head to look at you, then the others follow - all reaching out to add you to the collection here...

Once the amber husks are defeated they players will find the Mnemonic Lens amidst skeletal remains that had been preserved in amber.

#### X18. Hallway
> This twenty foot long, ten foot high hallway of bare stone has an amber door at each end.

#### X19. Potion Storage
> Stone blocks resembling tables stand in the centre of this room covered in dust. Carved into the stone walls are niches filled with hundreds of dusty bottles. Cobwebs hang from wooden ladders that lean against the walls.

The ceiling here is 15 feet high. Most of the bottles contain the dried-up remains of potions that lost their efficacy long ago. The ladders were once used to reach the higher niches, but they can no longer support any weight.  A long potion sits in the centre of the table, eldritch runes around it sputtering with faint light - but preserving the liquid inside of it.

#### X20. Architect's Room
>This small chamber hums faintly with restrained power. The walls are smooth black stone, subtly veined with amber that pulses like the slow heartbeat of something ancient. The only furnishings are a waist-high table in the center of the room, upon which is a model of the Amber Temple.  
>
> The table also features a large arm, the end of which is a lens of amber, with switches and dials not unlike a phoropter, which you can use to examine the model on the table in detail.  Around the edge of the amber lens, carved in lightly glowing runes, are the words: *"One place, many shadows.  One truth, endlessly masked"*

If the players fiddle with the lens and view the Amber Temple they can see 'other' Amber Temples:

>**Tovag, Domain of Kas the Betrayer:** This structure resembles a jagged shard of obsidian iron driven into a wasteland of ash and scorched stone. The structure is embedded within the splintered base of a massive, crumbling tower — as if the Temple grew parasitically from a wound in the tower's heart. Its amber surfaces are cracked and blackened, with runes of rebellion glowing faintly along its seams like embers refusing to die. Barbed chains wrap the edifice, some pulled taut as if restraining it, others hanging slack as if broken. Around its perimeter, tiny sculpted swords are half-buried in the ground, angled toward the Temple like the remnants of a long-forgotten siege. No figures move within it, but the shape seems _tense_, as though the model itself might erupt in violence if touched.

> **I'Cath, Domain of Tsien Chiang:**  This structure appears like a porcelain reliquary half-sunken into a cityscape of impossible geometry. Towering pagodas tilt at uncanny angles around it, their eaves curled like beckoning fingers, while streets spiral inward toward the Temple as though drawn by gravity. The Temple itself is composed of amber filigree and pale bone, formed into a lotus-like structure with petals half-peeled back to reveal a hollow core. Tiny dream-silk banners flutter from its spires though no wind touches them, each inscribed with script that rewrites itself when glimpsed out of the corner of one’s eye. A fine dust coats the entire model, suggesting long abandonment — or perhaps a sleep from which nothing wakes. Strange silhouettes of kneeling figures seem sculpted into the model's outer walls, their features indistinct, like memories eroding in a dream.

>**Darkon, Domain of Azalin Rex:** This structure in miniature form that sits upon the table, resembles a shattered cathedral built from jagged slabs of obsidian and honeyed glass, each pane veined with crawling fractures of arcane sigils. It stands atop a cracked basalt outcrop rising from a model wasteland of ash-grey forest and crumbled towns, all sculpted in eerie precision. The Temple’s outer walls are scorched and blackened in places, as though it survived a great magical catastrophe, yet its heart pulses with a dim inner light — a flickering nucleus of forbidden knowledge refusing to die. Around the base are tiny ruins of arcane laboratories and twisted statues of former scholars, their faces forever caught between awe and terror. A constant, faint haze clings to the model, as if even its scale representation emits magical fallout. On close inspection, cracks in the structure seem to spell out fragments of lost incantations in the ancient tongue of Il Aluk — the dead capital of a dead realm, still whispering secrets through the bones of the Temple.

>**Isle of the Ravens, Domain of the Lady of Ravens:** This structure appears like a windswept mausoleum carved from salt-stained marble and veined jet, its structure graceful yet mournful. Perched on a crag above crashing silver waves, the model is eternally surrounded by tiny sculpted ravens mid-flight, their wings unfurled as if caught in a perpetual spiral above the Temple’s peaked spires. The central dome is broken, revealing an inner sanctum lined with mirror-shards that reflect no light — only shadows. Around the base of the model lie delicate representations of gravestones, each etched with names in a forgotten script, and winding paths that lead nowhere but into fog. The entire model is tinged with subtle blue-grey hues, and when viewed at different angles, a thin veil seems to shimmer across its surface — as though the Temple is always halfway into the realm of memory and dream. A single sculpted figure stands at the highest parapet, cloaked and faceless, with a hand extended to the sky, calling something home.

#### X21. West Stairs
Three 10-foot-long staircases separated by 10-footsquare landings connect areas X18 and X36. Thick dust covering the stairs has not been disturbed in ages. The uppermost landing has secret doors set into its north and south walls. The south door opens into area X19, and the north door opens into area X20.  These can be noticed by a passive perception or a Wisdom (Perception) check of 15 and found by and Intelligence (Investigate) check of 15.

#### X22. Northwest Annex
> The scent of roasted meats and spiced wine and incense lingers as you enter a stone chamber of unsettling warmth. A long table of black marble, veined with amber, dominates the room, set meticulously for a grand feast. Golden goblets shimmer with deep red wine, a smoking censer of amber and obsidian sits in the middle of the table and silver platters bear glistening cuts of meat, spiced roots, and honeyed fruits not seen in any mortal land. Eight high-backed chairs encircle the table, each bearing a softly glowing sigil above its headrest — symbols of long-forgotten archmages, warlords, and seekers of forbidden knowledge.  Above, a chandelier of frozen amber hangs suspended, each crystalline branch containing a faintly flickering shadow — as if something once alive still stirs within. The walls are adorned with faded tapestries showing images of scholars partaking in strange rituals, feasting beside monstrous forms and figures cloaked in shadow.

In truth very little of what the party will experience upon entering is real.  The table is real, but crumbling, as are the chairs.  The lights, the food, the goblets are all illusory and any attempt to interact with them will reveal this fact.  The illusion is a memory, provided by the Censer of Memory, and will persist until the censer itself is disturbed.  When that happens...

> The feast's grandeur curdles: the food rots in an instant, turning to black sludge and crawling insects and then smoke. The goblets spill over with blood, and the glowing sigils above the chairs dim and crack. Eons pass in moments, and all begins to crumble and fall.  From beneath the table and shadows of the walls, the wights rise — dressed in the tattered robes of those who once supped here, cursed forever to repeat their final meal in service to the Temple's dark hunger.

After the battle the players can take the Censer of Memories with them.

#### X23. Northwest Balcony
> This black marble balcony overhangs the northwest corner of the temple, the floor of which lies thirty feet below. Nearly half of the balcony has fallen away, and obvious cracks have formed near its ragged edge.

This balcony is unsafe. Weight in excess of 250 pounds causes it to collapse. Any creature on the balcony when it collapses falls 30 feet to the temple floor below.

#### X24. West Shrine
> The scent of desiccated flesh and old incense clings to the stale air. Dust coats every surface of this stone-walled shrine, save for the circle of smooth floor surrounding a raised plinth at its center. Five ancient, shriveled corpses — some armored, some robed — lie crumpled and collapsed in various positions of worship or horror. Their fingers are brittle, flesh sucked tight to bone, and all face the statue as though drawn in their final moments to its gaze.
>
> Atop the plinth stands a humanoid-sized statue - no more than seven feet tall - carved from perfectly smooth amber. The figure wears archaic robes and a heavy hood that conceals most of its features. Beneath the hood is a blank oval of amber glass, where a face should be. It seems to shimmer faintly in the gloom, as if lit from within.  
>
> Its hands are held out, palms up, in an eternal offer.  Etched into the plinth in Supernal and Common: *"It is our will that binds.  It is our will that we shall be bound.”*

Anyone who enters this room must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be bound to the will of the shrine.  This is a curse that transforms the victim into a tool of the Temple.  It also acts as a filter, preventing those not fit to proceed from plumbing the deeper secrets of the Temple.  The curse imparts the following effects:

* Cursed individuals may not leave the shrine without succeeding on a DC 18 Chrisma saving throw.  They may attempt to leave once per hour.  Every hour they are away they must make another Charisma saving throw with a DC of 17+[Number of Hours Away] or be compelled to return to the shrine immediately.
* Cursed individuals gain a specific purpose, chosen at random from the following table.  To them this purpose is vitally important and they will refuse food and rest until this purpose is fulfilled (they cannot take short or long rests).  
* Because they neither eat nor rest, at dawn every day a cursed individual must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save they take a level of exhaustion.

| Roll | Purpose |
| -- | -- |
| 1 | *“Ensure no knowledge leaves this place unearned.”*  The cursed character must scrutinize every word, every artifact, interrogate their companions’ intentions — anything less is negligence. |
| 2 | *“Rebind what stirs in the dark.”* The character becomes convinced that the vestiges are waking — and that it is their duty to contain them. They cannot explain how, only that they must. |
| 3 | *“Cleanse the Temple of intruders and unbelievers.”* The party is now suspect. Outsiders may arrive. The character must prevent defilement — even through isolation, sabotage, or obstruction. |
| 4 | *“Translate the unspoken scripture carved into the stone itself.”* This imagined script is endless, unreadable, and possibly not real — but the character is determined to decipher it all. |
| 5 | “Restore the silence.”* Every sound — footsteps, speech, magic — is an affront. The character seeks absolute, sacred silence and may lash out at disruptions. |
| 6 | *“Bear witness to the cycles of the Temple.”* The Temple must be watched, always. Every moment, every flickering torch, every shifting shadow — recorded, internalized, preserved. |
| 7 | *“Seal every door, bar every path.”* | The Temple must remain closed. Even the character's own escape would break this vow. |
| 8 | *“Preserve the dying breath of the last true priest.”* No one knows who this priest was. But the character is certain their memory, breath, or soul is hidden here — and must not be lost. |
| 9 | *“Recreate the feast that bound the amber.”* The character becomes obsessed with gathering ingredients, re-enacting rituals, or preparing a symbolic feast that never ends. |
| 10 | *“Wait until the Temple is ready to speak.”*  The character believes the Amber Temple itself is sentient — a sleeping god or imprisoned intellect — and that it will one day awaken and deliver a divine truth. Until then, they must remain alert, listen for signs, interpret vibrations in the stone or flickers in the torches, and do nothing to disturb its silence. All other goals are secondary. They cannot leave. The Temple will speak, if only they wait long enough. |
| 11 | *“Speak the thousand names of what was once sealed.”* The character believes a list exists — a prayer or incantation that must be spoken, daily, forever. |
| 12 | *“Maintain the lie that this place was built for good.”*    The character is gripped by a deep need to defend the Temple’s original purpose — even to the point of self-deception or denial. |

This curse cannot be removed by the "Remove Curse" spell.  Remove Curse instead dampens the curse's negative effects for three hours (if Remove Curse is cast at a higher level it dampens the curse's negative effects for a number of hours equal to the spell slot used).  Greater Restoration will remove the curse.  Alternatively, smashing the statue will remove the curse for all affected.  The statue has an AC of 17 and 30 HP.  However in destroying the statue the following effects will be triggered:
* Any time the statue takes damage all cursed individuals suffer half that total as psychic damage.
* When the statue is destroyed anyone currently cursed by the statue must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage as their sense of purpose and identity splinters.

If players can justify with their curse (or if someone who did not get cursed) searches room have them roll an Intelligence (Investigate) check.  If they score DC 12 or higher they may acquire one of the following journal entries (check may be repeated every hour):

| Roll | Journal Entry |
| -- | -- |
| 1 | *From the journal of Malkir Voln of Aundair, 853 YK:* “It is not a place, but a condition. The Temple repeats across the filaments of dread, echoing like a scream down a canyon that never ends. Each iteration houses the same obsessions: containment, communion, collapse. I thought I would find forbidden knowledge. I did not expect to find it watching back. Amber is not a prison — it is a lens. And through it, the Vestiges see everything.” |
| 2 | *From the journal of High Anchorite Bellas Ren, 1460 DR:* "Since the rupture — since the Lich-God tore free from Cavitius — the Temple is dimmer. The amber burns low, as if starved. The visions are wild, fragmented. The Vestiges whisper, but not to me. They speak to each other now. In all my centuries of vigil, this has never happened. Something sacred is unraveling. Vecna did not just flee — he wounded the structure of the Temple itself."
| 3 | *From the notes of Orlis Dreeve of Haven, ethnographer and historian, 390 AC in shaking script:* "I merely looked. That was all. A statue, no more than a man’s height, but I felt it see me. No, mark me. I was not struck down, not enchanted. Just… burdened. A task fell upon me like the sun collapsing. I know it cannot be done. I know it. But I must. I have forgotten what it was I came here to find. I know only the task. I do not eat. I do not rest. The others say nothing anymore."
| 4 | *From the journal of Arishat of Tyr, FY 2:* “The statue binds with meaning. Not power. Not domination. Meaning. The curse is a purpose given form, and purpose can be unraveled. Burn its name. Deny its virtue. Desecrate its image. Three acts — defilement, denial, and forgetting. If done in unison, perhaps… perhaps it will release its hold. Or perhaps it will kill you, as it did me.” |
| 5 | *From the journal of Marik Yarrow of Cormyr, though the writing itself is signed Jansa Vey:* "Day three? Five? I don’t sleep anymore. Every time I try, I hear the statue’s voice — not words, but purpose. Over and over. A duty I didn’t ask for. I watched Marik try to leave. He made it to the threshold before his heart burst in his chest. He died facing the door, still reaching. I think he believed he could do it. I envy him that." |

The secret door in the north alcove can be detected by a passive perception of 15 or by a Wisdom (Perception) check of 15, however only individuals who are not cursed are able to notice it.  Once noticed it can be opened with a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigate) check (cursed individuals make this check with disadvantage)

#### X25. West Archer Post
> This narrow room has an arrow slit in the centre of the south wall.

#### X26. Secret Alcove
Two secret doors lead to this room.  When either is opened:

> Hundreds of skulls fall out of a cavity behind the door...

This room has a 30-foot-high ceiling and is packed floor to ceiling with human skulls. It takes 5 minutes for a single character to clear a path into the room. Multiple characters can work together to clear a path more quickly. Once the skulls are cleared away, characters can search the room.  Once cleared away:

> Attached to the thirty-foot-high ceiling of this dark sepulcher is an upside-down iron chest with a barrel-shaped lid.

The iron chest on the ceiling is held in place with sovereign glue, and its lid is sealed with an arcane lock spell. The chest is impervious to weapon damage. Prying it open requires a successful DC 15 Strength check, assuming the characters can reach it. The inside of the chest is lined with lead.  If the chest's lid is opened, the floor of this room disappears (as if affected by a disintegrate spell), creating a 10-foot-square hole above area X39. Creatures standing on the floor when it disappears fall 30 feet, landing in the northwest corner of area X39.

The iron chest is empty.

When inside this room the secret doors are obvious - they are only secret from the other side!

#### X27. High Priest's Room
> This fifteen-foot-high room contains the trappings of royalty: ornate furniture, exquisite rugs and tapestries, and decorative statuary. Everywhere you look are lit candelabras atop small tables.   On the western wall a massive, dusty tapestry hangs, sewn with threads of gold, silver and mithril and other splendorous colours.  An ornate, iron lock box sits upon a shelf, clasped with lock of gold, adamantine and rubies.  A mirror, made of polished amber, hangs on the north wall, held in place by some unknown opalescent metal.  Thick tomes, carefully bound, lay scattered in large piles.    
>
>The beauty of the decor is undone by thick dust and cobwebs. Sitting lifeless in one of the ornate chairs is a decrepit skeleton clad in tattered robes.

If the players investigate the tapestry they see an odd looking scene.  The tapestry depicts a building entirely of amber being summoned by a circle of robed figures.  The sky itself is fractured and lanced with lightning, and dotted with stars but as they move around the tapestry the image seems to shift subtly.  A 15 passive perception or a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the lightning seems to act as frames, and as one moves around the tapestry the skies seem to move from frame to frame.

If the players investigate the lock box it will require a DC 18 check with thieves tools.  Inside the party will find a kind of 'last will and testament' from the High Priest for some unknown successor.  Most of it is basic instructions on how to care for the temple, what to watch out for, how to use the library.  But the final line is chilling.  It reads:

> *Do not go into the vaults!  Do not venture there!  Silence was all I prayed for when I made that mistake!*  

If the players investigate the mirror they see a reflection not of themselves, but of the exterior of the Amber Temple - one that seems to change as they move around it.  There are cracks deep in the amber, and some kind of black substance seems to spiderweb from within.  A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals something much deeper - the Amber Temple the party is currently in is just a physical manifestation of something greater - and that the 'something greater' has a crack in its foundation.

If the players investigate the books they find a heavily annotated copy of a book called *'Gaze and Be Gazed Upon'*.  The book itself is an allegorical discussion of the nature of the Amber Temple that is difficult to understand, as it references things -events, places, people - that no one in the party is familiar with.  However annotations do reveal some of the mystery, suggesting that the Amber Temple is a test.  One note in particular stands out: *"The temple itself is the breath of the winnowing wind.  It peels back the falsehoods of reality, to see what you rebuild."*

If the party casts 'Speak With Dead' on the corpse they may learn the following, depending on the questions they ask (it may know other things, play by ear):
*  “The Temple was never built - it was manifested where needed, a cage for what cannot die and must not be remembered.”
*  “There are other Amber Temples in other domains, like echoes through broken glass.”
*  “The vestiges are not gods, but possibilities - cast-off intentions, aborted divinities, dreams that never woke.”
*  “Each sarcophagus contains a prisoner of idea and will. They do not speak in words, but in temptations.”
*  “The bindings weaken. Not from without, but from within. Some have already stretched into the world again.”
*  “To take a gift from the sarcophagi is to become a door.”
*  “Vecna pierced the veil not with power, but purpose. He is no longer here, yet he casts a shadow across every chamber.”
*  “When he fled Cavitius, his passage rippled through the Temple like a fracture through bone.”
*  “His escape dimmed the amber flame. The Temple is sick, and the sickness spreads.”
*  “Do not stay long. The Temple remembers. It hungers for stories to trap.”
*  “One shrine still binds. The others... dream of freedom.”  
*  “In the reflection, look sideways. You’ll see what you should not.”
*  “I died before the light failed. Whether by time or betrayal, I do not know.” 
*  “The Temple keeps me because it cannot forget me.”

The secret doors in this room can be noticed by a passive perception of 15 or a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, and can be opened with a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigate) check.  

#### X28. Not being used - ignore

#### X29. Secret Room
> Dust and cobwebs fill this otherwise empty room.

The secret doors in this room are readily visible from inside this room.

#### X30. Library
> This stone library has twenty-foot-high walls and a thirty-foot-high vaulted ceiling. Covering the ceiling is a fresco that depicts angels being set ablaze in a hell. A black marble railing encloses a gold marble staircase that spirals gently down a thirty-foot-wide, thirty-foot-deep shaft to the north. Against the gray walls stand six ten-foot-tall, black marble bookcases. On their shelves are hundreds of well-preserved tomes. Embroidered rugs, chairs, and lit candelabras fill the southern half of the room.

Players can summon books of the shelf here with relative ease, but reading them requires either a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check or reading the instructions in the high priest's lock box.  If they players pick up a book and fail to unlock it's knowledge the pages and the cover of the book remain blank.  Otherwise they may roll 1d8 and discover one of the following books (and gain one of the following boons while in the Temple):

#### X31. Central Catacombs
> You smell the horrid perfume of the ancient dead. Stone niches along the walls of these catacombs hold human-shaped amber husks, bones, and tattered shrouds.

These catacombs contain the moldy remains of the faithful who once defended the Amber Temple. Later generations of faithful who were corrupted by the evil of Vecna's escape smashed the amber sheaths covering the dead's bodies and stole everything of value, leaving the formerly preserved corpses to rot.

##### X31a. West Catacombs
> More skeletal remains fill niches in the walls of this smaller annex, the amber husks that once preserved them smashed beyond repair.

##### X31b. East Catacombs
> The niches set into the wall of this annex lie empty, except for a thick coat of dust.

No faithful were entombed herein.

#### X32. Lower East Hall
> The walls and ceiling of this great hall are coated in amber that glistens like fresh honey. Dust covers the black marble floor. To the north, the hall has collapsed, leaving a wall of rubble.

#### X33. Amber Vaults
The amber vaults contain Amber Sarcophagi - the prisons of the dark vestiges.  Any player who touches an Amber Sarcophagi, even in passing, will receive a brief imprint of the vestige contained within.  Prolonged contact will allow the vestige to talk to the individual, eventually leading to an offer

**Note:** Each of the vestiges will offer a unique pact with the individual, but the following is true for all of them:
* They will free the party and orchestrate the release of Kas the Betrayer
* To do this they must fight the spirit of the Warden in Area 42.
* If an individual is attuned to the Eye of Vecna they cannot make a deal - in fact they cannot receive even an imprint from the sarcophagi - for they are already bound in a way to the serpent.
* Freeing a vestige will result in the destruction of the Amber Temple (players should also be able to extrapolate that will also result in the destruction of the Domains of Dread.

##### X33a. The Vault of the Bound Warden
> This chamber lies in funereal stillness, its 60-foot cruciform shape defined by walls of polished amber and black stone that drink the light of your torches. In the eastern arm, a towering mosaic spans from floor to vaulted ceiling. Shattered amber shards have been painstakingly arranged to depict a faceless, robed figure collapsed to its knees, wrapped in chains that descend from a fractured sky. The figure’s chest is hollow—a dark, yawning cavity where its heart should be—and from the opening trickles a thin stream of golden light that stains the floor. Crimson lines radiate from its back like old wounds barely healed. The room smells faintly of scorched myrrh, and the floor beneath your feet hums with a tension barely contained, as if something ancient and unrelenting strains against unseen bonds.
>
> Three pillars of amber fill the western, southern and eastern arms of the cross.  From within the room things stir, and you see the lifeless husks of shattered amber start to move about.

###### Western Sarcophagus - Ultharic, the Root Below
*Appearance:* A massive, fibrous coil — like the root bundle of a dead tree — blackened and veined with blood-red strands. It pulses gently, as though drawing sustenance from unseen soil.
*History:* Ultharic once seeded worlds with thought-rot — concepts so virulent they drove entire civilizations to madness merely by being known. Language twisted. Meaning broke. Cultures collapsed into gibbering worship of unknowable things. It was captured only when the last of its acolytes uttered a counter-thought in a dying breath that silenced Ultharic for a single moment — just long enough to bind it in amber.
*Impression:* A sharp pressure builds in the skull. For an instant, every word the players know feels false — misshapen, writhing inside their minds. Then it passes, leaving behind a strange metallic taste and the sense that something has memorized their name.
*Dark Gift:*

###### Southern Sarcophagus - Ialvorr, the Hollow-Eyed Saint
*Appearance:* A withered humanoid figure, no larger than a child, sits cross-legged with a serene expression. Its eye sockets are empty pits from which a dim grey fog curls and coils, moving even in stasis.
*History:* Ialvorr once wandered planes posing as a prophet, offering divine wisdom to those in despair. Every revelation it gave hollowed its listeners further, replacing grief with apathy, purpose with stillness. Entire realms gave up on existing under its influence, their peoples vanishing into still, dead cities. Ialvorr did not lie — it simply revealed truths no mind could bear. It was sealed when it whispered its final gospel to an angel, and the angel wept salt that burned the creature into stillness.
*Impression:* A cold serenity fills the character. Their pain dulls. Their memories dim. For just a moment, they feel ready to let go of everything. A vision follows — an endless, silent desert of glass — then the moment is gone, and they gasp for breath.
*Dark Gift:*

###### Eastern Sarcophagus - Tzelin’ith, the Chain-Thorn Mother
*Appearance:* A jagged rift, almost like a frozen scream in space, spirals within the amber — teeth of crystalized shadow and tongues of pitch-black void flicker in and out of impossible angles.
*History:* Tharizvek is not a being, but a hunger with consciousness — a metaphysical wound that grew into desire. It devoured astral threads and soulstuff across realities, unraveling afterlives and consuming echoes of identity. Even the gods feared to name it. When it began to eat dreams from within the Far Realm, the Warden struck it down with chains forged of memory and sealed it here — where it waits, mouth open, still digesting echoes.
*Impression:* A wrenching hunger blooms in the gut. The player feels as if something within them has been tasted — not flesh, but meaning. A flickering vision follows: a candle in a black room, snuffed by unseen jaws.
*Dark Gift:*

##### X33b. The Vault of the Betrayed
> This chamber is still and quiet —sixty feet by sixty in the shape of a broad cross. The floor is fractured obsidian, shot through with veins of silver that flicker like lightning when stepped upon. Each of the four wings bears a shattered mosaic depicting a different oath or promise: a knight swearing fealty, a child offering a flower to a giant, a scholar teaching a young apprentice, and two lovers clasping hands. Each mosaic is violently broken, the faces defaced, the promises undone. The air smells faintly of ozone and dried blood, and a cold wind seems to stir despite the sealed walls. Something within the amber pulses faintly—accusing, wounded, and waiting.
>
> In the middle of the room a large, metallic creature stands - lifeless at first, then as you approach it starts to move towards you - threatening you for violating this place with your presence.

###### Northern Sarcophagus - Vathkala, the Herald Who Spoke Twice
*Appearance:* A tall, faceless figure cloaked in layers of scroll-like flesh, bound tightly around its form. The scrolls are written in two scripts — one luminous and one crawling in shadow — and they shimmer between meanings.
*History:* Vathkala once served as the voice of a celestial chorus, conveying divine will to the mortals below. But it began to deliver twin messages: one divine, one heretical — one to be heard, one to be believed. Kingdoms tore themselves apart obeying both. Prophets were discredited, faiths collapsed, oaths failed. It betrayed not a single soul, but the very concept of revelation. Sealed in amber after it whispered contradiction into the God-Tongue itself.
*Impression:* A memory the character once trusted becomes uncertain. A parent’s love, a teacher’s lesson, a vow — all flicker, fractured. A voice speaks in their head: “One truth for the ear. One for the heart.”
*Dark Gift:*

###### Eastern Sarcophagus - Yel-Shoras, the Worm Crowned
*Appearance:* A skeletal figure sits slumped on a stone throne, crowned with a writhing halo of translucent, maggot-like worms that glow faintly. Its hands are clasped in supplication; its eye sockets weep liquid void.
*History:* Yel-Shoras was once the steward of a divine realm, elevated by its creators to act as regent. But it succumbed to despair and let the stars fall, surrendering the gates of the realm to an enemy who never asked. It is not remembered as a traitor by those it served — only by the gods who had trusted it. For that silent, passive betrayal, it was unmade and cast down. The worms are all that remain of its penitent soul, crawling endlessly in its skull.
*Impression:* The character feels crushing guilt for something they haven’t done. A sudden, vivid vision: they stand at the gates of a golden city, and the doors swing open not because they knock — but because they walk away.
*Dark Gift:*

###### Southern Sarcophagus - Aelinthar, the Hand That Was Promised
*Appearance:* A gigantic severed hand, fingers splayed, floating upright in the center of the amber. Eyes open and close along the knuckles and palm. Occasionally, it clenches in slow, shuddering spasms.
*History:* Aelinthar was forged as a weapon by a pantheon, prophesied to deliver the death-blow to a great evil. But when the moment came, it hesitated. Whether by doubt, fear, or pity — no one knows. The evil escaped, and a thousand worlds burned. The betrayal was not one of allegiance, but of purpose. The gods tore the will from Aelinthar and cast it into the Amber Temple before it could speak its defense.
*Impression:* The character hears a battle cry freeze in their own throat. A thousand voices beg them to act — and their hand doesn’t move. A vision of an empty battlefield, strewn with ash, where all waited for a strike that never came.
*Dark Gift:*

##### X33c.  The Vault of the One Yet to Come
###### Northern Sarcophagus - The Mirrorborn Choir
*Appearance:* A swirling helix of humanoid forms with mirrored faces, spiraling upward like a strand of living DNA. Their mouths are open in eternal song, but no sound emerges. The inner surface of the amber reflects the viewer’s face — aged, ruined, corrupted.
*History:* The Mirrorborn Choir are avatars of a future truth — when all souls sing the same song and individuality dies. They are not conquerors, but an infection of consensus: harmony so perfect it annihilates selfhood. Once mistaken for angels, their worship spread rapidly until entire planes surrendered not to gods, but to the promise of unity without choice. The Amber Temple holds them in stasis before they can begin the song again.
*Impression:* The character hears a note buried under all other sounds — a note they realize has always been there. It’s beautiful. It welcomes them. It asks nothing except to never stop listening.

###### Eastern Sarcophagus -  Lythal-On, the Seed Beyond Time
*Appearance:* A pulsing cocoon of bone and root, floating vertically in the center of the amber sarcophagus. Inside is the silhouette of a fetus with too many limbs and no face, twitching in slow, stuttering pulses.
*History:* Lythal-On has not yet been born. It is a gestation of apocalypse from a timeline yet to crystallize — a child destined to overthrow the cosmic order by becoming the god of endings. The amber tomb halts the flow of time around it, trapping the creature forever in pre-birth, forestalling a ruin it hasn’t committed. To touch the tomb is to know it will happen, if ever released.
*Impression:* The character sees a star give birth to darkness instead of light. They feel a deep, instinctive revulsion — not from fear, but from the certainty that the thing before them will one day know their name.
    
###### Southern Sarcophagus - Threxil, the Question That Ends Worlds
*Appearance:* A vast, serpent-like entity coiled in endless loops. Its head is a void in space, where no light reflects. On its coils are etched unpronounceable glyphs that shimmer when observed. Occasionally, the amber hums with static, as if something just tried to speak.
*History:* Threxil is not a creature, but a paradox — a thoughtform from a plane of unlogic. Its curse is inquiry: it plants a question in the minds of those who perceive it, and the question undoes the fabric of understanding. Entire civilizations have fallen after unlocking the thought it implanted — not because it was evil, but because the mind isn’t built to know it. The Amber Temple imprisoned Threxil before its presence could unravel reality further.
*Impression on Contact:* The character feels a question well up inside them. It has no words, no subject — just a profound need to know something no being should ever know. They feel their teeth ache, as if reality itself were bracing for impact.

##### X33d. The Vault of the One Who Escaped
###### Western Sarcophagus -  Goo-gall, the Archivore
*Appearance:* A vast centipede formed of ink-soaked scrolls and flayed vellum, curled into a spiral. Its many eyes are missing — torn out — and its parchment skin is burned along one edge, as if something escaped through it.
*History:* Goo-gall was a gluttonous entity that fed not on flesh, but on knowledge itself. It consumed libraries, spells, gods of memory — digesting truth and regurgitating lies. It was captured after erasing an entire age from the multiverse's history. Before Vecna’s escape, Goo-gall shared its prison wall — and part of it was devoured. It remembers the escape. It dreams of escape.
*Impression:* The character forgets something important — the name of a loved one, or why they came here. In its place is a false memory: a hallway of endless shelves, and a whisper that says, “You don’t need to remember, I’ll remember for you.”

###### Eastern Sarcophagus - Iag-Zor, the King in Scraps
*Appearance:* A humanoid shape stitched from mismatched parts — one arm a massive crustacean claw, the other a bird’s wing. Its head is a rotating iron mask, constantly reshaping into new forms: a child, a king, a beast, a screaming blank slate.
*History:* Iag-Zor ruled a broken world by changing to match the fear of every soul he ruled. He is not a person, but a reflection of collective trauma. When Vecna escaped, he left behind a wound in reality, and Iag-Zor pressed its face to it, whispering until the crack nearly widened. The Temple sealed it again — just in time. Iag-Zor remains, sulking in its prison, waiting for fear to reshape the crack.
*Impression:*  The character sees their own face on the other side of the amber, twisted by grief or shame. The face smiles and asks, “What are you without your wound?”
    
##### X33e. The Vault of the Betrayer
###### Northern Sarcophagus - Ur’thak the Vowless
*Appearance:* A statuesque figure bound in barbed chains of light, yet grinning — a smirk carved into its inhumanly smooth face. Its form is genderless, robed in flowing glass, with no eyes and a hundred whispering mouths across its limbs.
*History:* Once a celestial arbiter, Ur’thak judged and sealed pacts between gods and mortals. But it grew weary of promise, and broke its final vow: to remain neutral. With a single proclamation, it unraveled a divine accord and set a pantheon to war. When bound, it refused remorse, claiming, “No bond holds if I do not believe in it.”
*Impression:* A sudden, gut-wrenching doubt seizes the character. For a moment, every oath, vow, and promise they’ve ever made feels brittle and hollow. A voice murmurs, “All things betray you in time — why not be first?”

###### Western Sarcophagus - Xal'Dun the Unfeathered
*Appearance:* A great, skeletal raven with wings of black ichor that drip and vanish before touching the floor. Its head is turned completely backwards, as if unwilling to see where it now resides. Feathers scatter through the amber — or do they still move?
*History:* Xal'Dun was a divine messenger and steward of fate in a far realm — until it delivered a prophecy that it knew would doom its own god. Why? It wished to see what would happen. For this act of cosmic voyeurism, it was cast down, but never repented. “Even the end,” it said, “deserves an audience.”
*Impression:*  The character hears the fluttering of wings and feels the unbearable sensation of being watched — not by a presence, but by the future. They see a brief flash: themselves, dying — smiling. A raven lands on their chest and whispers, “Wasn’t it beautiful?”
 
###### Southern Sarcophagus - Thallidrex the Sibling Thorn
*Appearance:* A tree-like humanoid with a bleeding core where its heart should be. Its bark is made of pale, crystalline bone. Branches from its back stretch outward to embrace a twin that is no longer there — only severed stumps remain. The expression on its face is one of anguished longing.
*History:* Thallidrex was once one of two great primal entities — twin guardians of an ancient realm. But it coveted its sibling’s bond with the people of that world and sowed ruin, causing its sibling’s death. Afterward, Thallidrex wept and rooted itself at the grave, refusing to move… until it was imprisoned for what it had done.
*Impression:*  A vine of sorrow curls around the character’s thoughts. For an instant, they feel overwhelming jealousy toward an ally — irrational, all-consuming — before it’s gone. In their mind, a whisper: “All twins end in betrayal. You can be first. You must.”

##### X33f. The Vault of the Tempter
###### Western Sarcophagus - Serethal, the Golden Tongue
*Appearance:* A perfect humanoid figure, sexless and serene, with a radiant golden mask affixed where its mouth should be. Beneath the mask, faintly, its jaw still moves. Thousands of fine, golden threads spill from its fingertips, entangling the inside of the amber in elaborate knots that shimmer faintly with ancient languages.
*History:* Serethal once served as the voice of a forgotten god of knowledge, but grew jealous of its master’s silence. It began to speak in its name — at first truths, then half-truths, then whatever would provoke devotion. Entire civilizations fell to ruin seeking wisdom Serethal invented to please them.
*Impression on Contact:* The character’s tongue tingles, their thoughts alight with eloquence. For a fleeting moment, they feel they could talk a god into dying. Then, a whisper: “All words shape the world. Why let others do the shaping?”

###### Southern Sarcophagus -  Vilissyth, the Seed Within
*Appearance:* A many-limbed, insectile shape, all carapace and chitin, wrapped around a pulsing, oversized heart — one that is not its own. Its amber glistens wet, as if it’s breathing. Its mandibles are not sharp but delicate, probing — made for burrowing inward.
 *History:* Vilissyth’s true body was long lost, but its influence lived on in a psychic seed it implanted in hosts across worlds. Whispering in dreams, it turned the meek into tyrants, the faithful into heretics. Its ultimate goal remains unclear — only that it _feeds_ on temptation itself.
 *Impression:*  The character feels something wriggling at the back of their mind. An urge — to confess something awful. Or to act upon a hidden desire. Something inside them is... waiting to hatch. “I’m already inside,” it coos, “and we both want the same thing.”

###### Eastern Sarcophagus - Inmathir, the Mirror Widow**
*Appearance:* A cloaked figure with a veil of glimmering glass shards in place of a face. Behind each shard is a different face — different ages, different genders, different species — all silently screaming. Its hands are graceful and beckoning. Where it should cast a shadow, it reflects light instead.
*History:** Inmathir was once a muse of transformation, offering mortals visions of their "truest selves" — always beautiful, always powerful. But the forms she offered were lies. Kingdoms destroyed themselves chasing unattainable perfection, carving themselves into mockeries. She never harmed a soul directly — but none were ever the same after looking into her.
    
-   **Impression on Contact:**  
    _The character sees themselves, briefly, as something else — glorious, terrifying, unrecognizable. A sudden craving to _become_ that reflection washes over them. “You were never meant to be what you are,” a voice says. “Let me show you what you could have been.”_
