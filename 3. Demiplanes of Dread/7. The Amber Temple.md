# The Amber Temple
> As you wind your way through the snow-choked mountain path, the cold intensifies - not just in temperature, but in presence. The wind here doesn't whistle or howl; it whispers, low and guttural, threading through the stones like the breath of something ancient.
>
> And then you see it.
>
> Carved directly into the mountainside, a black shape looms from the cliff face: the Amber Temple. A staircase of cracked stone leads down into a wide courtyard before its entrance—yet the structure beyond seems wrong against the pale white snow. Where the sun strikes the mountains, the temple drinks in the light and offers nothing back. Its massive amber columns, once gilded by age and grandeur, now seem to bleed shadow. Not even the reflected gleam of snow touches its surface.
> 
> For those with dark vision, the shadows still cling—thicker than they should be, heavier somehow, as if the darkness itself resents being seen. Edges blur. Shapes shift at the corners of your vision. The great bronze doors ahead are shut tight, flanked by still guardian statues half-buried in drifting snow, their eyes dark hollows that seem to follow your approach.
> 
> The very air near the temple feels different - denser - like the atmosphere just before a storm, or a breath held far too long. Something waits inside.
>
>And it knows you're coming.

## What's Really Going On Here
**Nature of the Amber Temple:** The Amber Temple in Barovia is the physical manifestation of the metaphysical concept - the essence of the Demiplanes of Dread themselves.  In truth there is an equivalent of the Amber Temple in every one of the domains of Ravenloft - one for every Dread Lord, built upon a foundation of the fears, regrets, obsessions and the nature of their prison made manifest.  

**Nature of the Dark Powers:** The Dark Powers are not gods - not truly.  They are ideas with so much metaphysical weight that they manifest their existence as a nominal power.  Unlike other beings in the cosmos they cannot be killed or destroyed - only bound and imprisoned, held apart so that they do not run wild across the cosmos.

**Why a Temple to Vecna:** The Amber Temple appears to be dedicated to Vecna.  This is both true and not true.  It reflects the impact Vecna has had on the metaphysical Amber Temple.  In ages past Vecna discovered the true Amber Temple.  Always hungry for power, Vecna laboured and unbound one of the Dark Powers imprisoned there - the Serpent - and struck a bargain with it.  The Serpent and Vecna are one, bound together.  

**The Path From Here:** The party will have to do the following to move on from here:
* Discover the nature of the Temple, the nature of the Dark Powers so that they can use it to secure the cosmos against Vecna's ritual (if the players fail this Kas can be used to provide this information).  They may also realize that Vecna has liberated one of the Dark Powers, but that is mostly flavour text.
* Convince at least one of the Vestiges in the Amber Temple (shards of the Dark Powers) that they should be let go.  Bonus points if they convince the Dark Powers to let them free Kas to go with them.  
* Strike a bargain (no matter how convincing the party is, they will have to strike a bargain to gain the assistance of the Dark Powers).

## Areas
### X1. Exterior
> You move slow, inexorably, towards the light drinking facade.  As you get close you notice the statues that line alcoves in the wall.  Carved from a black rock that was ancient when the world was new, they look out at you - staring at you.  Judging you.

The doors of the Amber Temple will not open until the party examines each statue.  They are (left to right):

**First Statue**
*Description:* A hooded figure with arms crossed in front of a hollow chest, face hidden in darkness. The surface is worn smooth as if by the weeping of a thousand mourners.
*Inscription:* "The Weight of Promises Kept."
*Lore:* The Bound Warden, this statue represents the seeds of Ravenloft itself.

**Second Statue**
*Description:* A naked figure, half-human, half-snake, blindfolded and smiling. One hand cradles a book made of bone. The other is dipped in molten gold, as though caught mid-offering. 
*Inscription:* "The Price of Knowing."
*Lore:* 

**Third  Statue**
*Description:* A knight in shattered armor, impaled by a dozen swords — each driven inward by its own gauntleted hands. There is no head. Where the neck ends, a snake coils up toward the sky.
*Inscription:* "The Betrayer Crowned."
*Lore:* 

**Fourth Statue**
*Description:* A child, carved in haunting detail, holding a severed wing like a doll. From the wing’s roots trail veins of amber that bleed into the stone below. The face is neither innocent nor cruel — merely watching.
*Inscription:* "The First Pact."
*Lore:* 

**Fifth Statue**
*Description:* A gaunt scholar, faceless - save for a gaping hole where the left eye would be on a man, with a crown of thorns carved from runes. In place of a right arm is a broken spike of obsidian, jagged and unhealed. The left hand is open in benediction or command. Behind the hooded head, faintly, a serpent coils.
*Inscription:* "The One Who Escaped."
*Lore:* 

**Sixth Statue**
*Description:* A nondescript statue - blank, save for the face which is a mirror, cracked but not shattered, carved from obsidian and ringed in amber flame. In it each of you sees your own outline reflected within, _flickering_, shifting… as though weighed and measured.
*Inscription:* "The Price of Knowing."
*Lore:* The Bound Warden, this statue represents the seeds of Ravenloft itself.
