# The Amber Temple
Finally the party reaches the Amber Temple...

## What's Really Going On Here
This is where the 'secret' of the Demiplanes of Dread comes together.  The Amber Temple of Barovia is not the true Amber Temple.  The Amber Temple (or whatever it might be called) is actually the structure of the Demiplanes of Dread themselves - the prison in which the Dark Powers are bound.  The nature of this prison is such that it manifests itself physically in the every domain of Ravenloft.  Each 'Amber Temple' is slightly different - built upon a foundation of the paired Dread Lords own fears, regrets and obsessions - but each is the essence of Ravenloft made manifest. 



**The Path From Here:** The party will have to do the following to move on from here:
* Discover the nature of the Temple, the nature of the Dark Powers so that they can use it to secure the cosmos against Vecna's ritual (if the players fail this Kas can be used to provide this information).  They may also realize that Vecna has liberated one of the Dark Powers, but that is mostly flavour text.
* Convince at least one of the Vestiges in the Amber Temple (shards of the Dark Powers) that they should be let go.  Bonus points if they convince the Dark Powers to let them free Kas to go with them.  
* Strike a bargain (no matter how convincing the party is, they will have to strike a bargain to gain the assistance of the Dark Powers).

## Areas
### X1. Exterior
> As you wind your way through the snow-choked mountain path, the cold intensifies - not just in temperature, but in presence. The wind here doesn't whistle or howl; it whispers, low and guttural, threading through the stones like the breath of something ancient.
>
> And then you see it.
>
> Carved directly into the mountainside, a black shape looms from the cliff face: the Amber Temple. A staircase of cracked stone leads down into a wide courtyard before its entrance—yet the structure beyond seems wrong against the pale white snow. Where the sun strikes the mountains, the temple drinks in the light and offers nothing back. Its massive amber columns, once gilded by age and grandeur, now seem to bleed shadow. Not even the reflected gleam of snow touches its surface.
> 
> For those with dark vision, the shadows still cling—thicker than they should be, heavier somehow, as if the darkness itself resents being seen. Edges blur. Shapes shift at the corners of your vision. The great bronze doors ahead are shut tight, flanked by still guardian statues half-buried in drifting snow, their eyes dark hollows that seem to follow your approach.
> 
> The very air near the temple feels different - denser - like the atmosphere just before a storm, or a breath held far too long. Something waits inside.
>
>And it knows you're coming.
>
> Your eyes flick to the guardian statues, and you get a sense that each is watching you in some way.  Each is carved from a black stone that was ancient when the world was new and each figure it different.  The first (on the left) is a hooded figure, with arms crossed in front of a hollow chest.  Its face is hidden in the shadows of its cloak, it's features worn smooth as if by the weeping of countless tears by infinite mourners.  On the base is inscribed the words *'The Weight of Promises Kept'*
>
> The second statue is a naked, half-human, half-snake figure - blindfolded and smiling.  One hand cradles a book made from bone.  The other is dipped in molten gold - as though caught mid-offering.  Beneath it are the words *'The Price of Knowing'*
> 
> The third statue is a warrior.  He stands, his blade cracked, his head held high and haughty - not in triumph, but in justification.  His brows furrowed,  his lips curled in denial, as if whispering 'I had no choice'.  In his off hand he holds a crown that weighs upon him.  Beneath him are the words *'The Betrayer Crowned'*
> >
>  The fourth statue kneels in its alcove - robed and pierced through the back with multiple blades - not metal or even stone, but formed from amber and shadow.  Their head is bowed, their face is cracked like porcelain - leaking a faint, golden light from within.  Their hands are open in confusion.  Beneath it are the words *'The Knife's Other Edge'*
>  >
>  The fifth statue is that of a gaunt scholar, faceless except for a gaping hole where the left eye would be on a man.  He wears a crown of thorns carved with runes.  It is missing it's right arm, cut off at the elbow.  The left hand is open - in benediction or command.  Behind his hooded head a serpent coils.   Beneath him is carved the words *'The One Who Escaped'*.  
>  >
>  The final statue is odd.  It stands, nondescript, simply standing at rest with its head lowered.  


**First Statue**
*Description:* A hooded figure with arms crossed in front of a hollow chest, face hidden in darkness. The surface is worn smooth as if by the weeping of a thousand mourners.
*Inscription:* "The Weight of Promises Kept."
*Lore:* The Bound Warden, this statue represents the seeds of Ravenloft itself and by extension the Amber Temple itself.

**Second Statue**
*Description:* A naked figure, half-human, half-snake, blindfolded and smiling. One hand cradles a book made of bone. The other is dipped in molten gold, as though caught mid-offering. 
*Inscription:* "The Price of Knowing."
*Lore:* The malevolence behind the Dark Powers of Ravenloft.  This statue is the Dark Powers.  

**Third  Statue**
*Description:* A knight in shattered armor, impaled by a dozen swords — each driven inward by its own gauntleted hands. There is no head. Where the neck ends, a snake coils up toward the sky.
*Inscription:* "The Betrayer Crowned."
*Lore:* Every Dread Lord is guilty of one crime above all others.  Betrayal.  Kas betrayed Vecna.  Strahd betrayed his brother.  The Dark Powers crown traitors in this prison.

**Fourth Statue**
*Description:* This statue is smaller than the others, more human in scale, but no less striking. A robed figure kneels, pierced through the back by multiple ethereal blades — not metal, but formed of translucent amber and shadow. Their head is bowed, and their face is cracked like porcelain, leaking faint golden light from within. The hands are open in confusion or forgiveness.
*Inscription:* "The Knife’s Other Edge."
*Lore:* This represents the opposite of the third statue - for every betrayer there must be one betrayed.

**Fifth Statue**
*Description:* A gaunt scholar, faceless - save for a gaping hole where the left eye would be on a man, with a crown of thorns carved from runes. In place of a right arm is a broken spike of obsidian, jagged and unhealed. The left hand is open in benediction or command. Behind the hooded head, faintly, a serpent coils.
*Inscription:* "The One Who Escaped."
*Lore:* Clearly Vecna

**Sixth Statue**
*Description:* A nondescript statue - blank, save for the face which is a mirror, cracked but not shattered, carved from obsidian and ringed in amber flame. In it each of you sees your own outline reflected within, flickering, shifting… as though weighed and measured.
*Inscription:* "The Sixth is Always Becoming."
*Lore:* This represents the players.  By coming here they have inserted themselves into this cycle.  What role will they play?

**Nature of the Amber Temple:** The Amber Temple in Barovia is the physical manifestation of the metaphysical concept - the essence of the Demiplanes of Dread themselves.  In truth there is an equivalent of the Amber Temple in every one of the domains of Ravenloft - one for every Dread Lord, built upon a foundation of the fears, regrets, obsessions and the nature of their prison made manifest.  

**Nature of the Dark Powers:** The Dark Powers are not gods - not truly.  They are ideas with so much metaphysical weight that they manifest their existence as a nominal power.  Unlike other beings in the cosmos they cannot be killed or destroyed - only bound and imprisoned, held apart so that they do not run wild across the cosmos.

**Why a Temple to Vecna:** The Amber Temple appears to be dedicated to Vecna.  This is both true and not true.  It reflects the impact Vecna has had on the metaphysical Amber Temple.  In ages past Vecna discovered the true Amber Temple.  Always hungry for power, Vecna laboured and unbound one of the Dark Powers imprisoned there - the Serpent - and struck a bargain with it.  The Serpent and Vecna are one, bound together.
