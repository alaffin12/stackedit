# The Amber Temple
> As you wind your way through the snow-choked mountain path, the cold intensifies - not just in temperature, but in presence. The wind here doesn't whistle or howl; it whispers, low and guttural, threading through the stones like the breath of something ancient.
>
> And then you see it.
>
> Carved directly into the mountainside, a black shape looms from the cliff face: the Amber Temple. A staircase of cracked stone leads down into a wide courtyard before its entrance—yet the structure beyond seems wrong against the pale white snow. Where the sun strikes the mountains, the temple drinks in the light and offers nothing back. Its massive amber columns, once gilded by age and grandeur, now seem to bleed shadow. Not even the reflected gleam of snow touches its surface.
> 
> For those with dark vision, the shadows still cling—thicker than they should be, heavier somehow, as if the darkness itself resents being seen. Edges blur. Shapes shift at the corners of your vision. The great bronze doors ahead are shut tight, flanked by still guardian statues half-buried in drifting snow, their eyes dark hollows that seem to follow your approach.
> 
> The very air near the temple feels different - denser - like the atmosphere just before a storm, or a breath held far too long. Something waits inside.
>
>And it knows you're coming.

## What's Really Going On Here
**Nature of the Amber Temple:** The Amber Temple in Barovia is the physical manifestation of the metaphysical concept - the essence of the Demiplanes of Dread themselves.  In truth there is an equivalent of the Amber Temple in every one of the domains of Ravenloft - one for every Dread Lord, built upon a foundation of the fears, regrets, obsessions and the nature of their prison made manifest.  

**Nature of the Dark Powers:** The Dark Powers are not gods - not truly.  They are ideas with so much metaphysical weight that they manifest their existence as a nominal power.  Unlike other beings in the cosmos they cannot be killed or destroyed - only bound and imprisoned, held apart so that they do not run wild across the cosmos.

**Why a Temple to Vecna:** The Amber Temple appears to be dedicated to Vecna.  This is both true and not true.  It reflects the impact Vecna has had on the metaphysical Amber Temple.  In ages past Vecna discovered the true Amber Temple.  Always hungry for power, Vecna laboured and unbound one of the Dark Powers imprisoned there - the Serpent - and struck a bargain with it.  The Serpent and Vecna are one, bound together.  

**The Path From Here:** The party will have to do the following to move on from here:
* Discover the nature of the Temple, the nature of the Dark Powers so that they can use it to secure the cosmos against Vecna's ritual (if the players fail this Kas can be used to provide this information).  They may also realize that Vecna has liberated one of the Dark Powers, but that is mostly flavour text.
* Convince at least one of the Vestiges in the Amber Temple (shards of the Dark Powers) that they should be let go.  Bonus points if they convince the Dark Powers to let them free Kas to go with them.  
* Strike a bargain (no matter how convincing the party is, they will have to strike a bargain to gain the assistance of the Dark Powers).
