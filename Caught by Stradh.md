# Caught by Stradh
## Setup
At the conclusion of their adventure into the Mournlands the party will have had the opportunity to gain one of the secrets needed to stabilize the cosmos.  Of course that was the easy one - the one Mordenkainen outlined in his thesis about the Tome of True Balance.

Fortunately the automata that are part of Mordenkainen's Bastion have been hard at work cataloguing data while the party is away (N-C4R-T4).  They have found another snippet of Mordenkainen's writings which leads them to the next step...

> The Domains of Dread.
>  
>  An interesting demiplane that seems to be co-terminus with every realm I have encountered in all the cosmos.  That seems interesting, but it does not seem stable enough - after all, the Orrey of the Planes allows me to travel to any realm I choose.  In some ways it too touches all other realms.  And I am hardly a master of planar travel.
>  
>  But there is something there I think.  Not the demiplane itself.  But the forces that style themselves its rulers.  I had the misfortune to be trapped in one not long ago.  One overseen by a petty tyrant named Stradh who styled himself some kind of god-king.  But I came to learn he was no god.  In a temple in that realm there was knowledge of things greater than Stradh.  Creatures that were keeping that monster a prisoner even as they granted him dominion over Barovia.  The so-called 'Dark Powers'.  
>  
>  I wish I had learned more then, but my mind was focused on my own escape. With the assistance of an odious dwarf who thought himself a holy man, but was clearly a sorcerer of some sort, a tabaxi and the reborn focus of Stradh's 'affection' we defeated Stradh - for a time at least. I do not relish the idea of going back there.  I could easily be trapped again.  
>  
>  But perhaps I do not need to.  The Domains of Dread hold many prisoners who think themselves petty tyrants.  And there is one amongst them who hates Vecna above all else.  Kas the Betrayer.  Perhaps I should should make for Tovag, and find myself an ally - even if I will have to be on my guard with him.

Presumably they'll return to the Orrey and try and make their way to Tovag.  However as they do...

> You step into the portal formed by the Orrey, but instead of stepping out into the forested realm you had expected you step into inky blackness.
> 
> The space, if it can be called that - for it is more like an absence of space - is filled with countless voices that you cannot make out, but you can feel in your bones.  In your soul.  They scream at you.  They call you intruders.  Say you are working for the fugitive.  That you are here to free another prisoner.  You would fall to your knees in pain from the cacophony - if you had knees.  Like the voices you seem to only exist here as a voice.  A thought.
> 
> And then once voice silences all.  "You know, my masters, that I am always happy to take interesting playthings into my realm.  Send them to me, so they do not disturb you any further..."
>
> The void fades, and you wake up around the embers of a campfire as dawn is approaching.  But something inside of you feels off... the dawn is dull, grey.  Swallowed by clouds.  And you are somewhere you did not expect to be...

## Barovia
##### Notes of Barovia
One of the Demiplanes of Dread, Barovia is subject to the following rules:
* Supernatural mists surround Barovia and keep its prisoners imprisoned.  Anyone trying to leave Barovia gets lost in the mists and winds up back where they started - no exceptions (Stradh does frequently allow the Vistani to leave - but that is only by his parole, something he will not offer the players).
*  Stradh, being a vampire, is not terribly interested in having the sun shining in his realm.  As such, heavy cloud almost always obscures the sun, bathing the world in dim light that does not impact creatures who are affected by the sun.  Vampires still tend to be nocturnal though (easier hunting) and magic that causes sunlight does function as normal.
* Vistani is another name for Tabaxi in Barovia

Additionally, some magic functions differently:
* Any spell that would allow someone to escape the domain simply fails (after all, what good is a jail that can be escape with a plane shift).  This includes spells like banishment.  Simply put - what is in Barovia stays in Barovia unless Stradh or the Dark Powers get involved.
* Summoning spells fail for similar reasons, although spells that call familiars or companions do function - they simply call on local spirits and energies (as opposed to summoning a fire elemental from the elemental planes or a planetar from Celestia).
* Spells that utilize extra-dimensional spaces do function, but effects that would tear a hole in reality (putting a portable hole in a bag of holding for example) cause the same catastrophic effects, but do not create a hole in reality leading to the astral plane)
* Basically - there's no quick and easy escapes from the Domains of Dread.  If there was some of the characters imprisoned there (which once included Vecna) would easily escape. 
* Any magic that allows communications with entities on other planes is usable, with the proviso that Stradh can always (and does always) listen in on such communication, or if he wishes, he can redirect the call to himself and respond as if he were the entity being contacted.

### The Story as Planned
There is no intention for the players to play out the 'Curse of Stradh' as (a) the party are high enough level to trivialize most of the encounters and (b) the party are already in another adventure.  

Rather, upon awakening in the Svalich Woods and heading west (heading east brings them to the Gates of Barovia and the mists that keep prisoners in their cell) the party should know enough to make for the Amber Temple, to learn of their jailers (something they need to do to save the cosmos) and maybe find a means of escape.

The focus is going to be placed upon the locations in Barovia the players are likely to visit in the pursuit of this goal.  If they go off script you may have to improvise...

### The Village of Barovia (Area E)
The first place the players encounter as they head west is the village from which the land gets its name...

> A dense, unnatural mist clings to the crooked, rutted road as it winds into the heart of Barovia, a village suffocated by gloom. Sagging, decrepit houses lean toward the muddy streets, their shutters rattling in the cold wind like whispered warnings. The air is thick with damp rot, the scent of mildew and despair mingling with the faint iron tang of something fouler. The dim sunlight in this place barely punches through the broken windows, illuminating gaunt faces that vanish at the slightest movement. A church bell tolls weakly in the distance, its sound lost in the oppressive silence that blankets the village—a silence broken only by the occasional sob of an unseen mourner.

#### Unnamed Locations
If players visit an location that is not otherwise noted as being significant on the map they encounter on of the following inside the house: 

| d20 | Occupants |
| - | - |
| 1-3 | Empty |
| 4-8 | Rats! |
| 9-16 | Barovian Villagers |
| 17-20 | 4+2*1d4 Ghosts |

#### Entering Town
As the players enter town they meet Morgantha, a blood hag disguised as a kindly old woman, exiting a house...

> You hear a door open and as your head snaps around to see the source of the noise you see a kindly looking old woman dressed in rags stepping out from inside.  She says something unheard to an occupant inside the house, turns and deposits a coin in a box she wears on her hip.  She moves to a nearby cart, looking over at you and smiling.  "Hm?  You're not from around here are you?  Could I interest you in one of my delicious hand pies?"

Morgantha is evil and works with her mother and daughter at the Old Bonegrinder windmill, stealing the souls of children to make her special pies.  However the pies do have useful magical properties (detailed below) and the party does not know Morgantha is evil yet.  Also as she is portraying a kindly (if somewhat shabby) old lady she will help the players with the following information:

* The only inn in town is the "Blood on the Vine" public house.  Calling it an inn is a stretch - it doesn't have rooms, just a common room with a hearth.  However it is warm, dry and safe at night.  
* The Blood on the Vine is owned by three Vistani women.  Morgantha doesn't know much about the women or about the Vistani in general
* The is a semi-permanent Vistani camp nearby as well, near the Tser Pool.  It's about four hours if you follow the road, on the other side of the Ivalis River.
* Stradh is a powerful ruler - the party should avoid crossing him if possible.
* Morgantha's pies are made by her and her mother.  They usually have potato and turnip filling, along with meat if they can get some from the hunters.  Wolf meat is most common (and is what she has today) owing to how common it is in Barovia.
* If asked why they are so expensive (a gold each) Morgantha will explain that her, her daughter and her mother use a little bit of the old magic - something that has been passed down from mother to daughter through her family for a long time.  Anyone who eats one will have on the sweetest dreams that night.  Sadly, such things have to be done right to get the magic to work - and doing things right costs gold in Barovia.  "It's not like I can use the cheap cast offs the hunters give away cheap, or rotten old potatoes."

#### E1. Bildrath's Mercantile
>The sparse light from this building spills out from behind drawn heavy curtains. A sign over the door, creaking on its hinges, reads “Bildrath’s Mercantile.”

Bildrath Cantemir works a general store here.  It sells basic adventuring gear (everything from the PHB labelled adventuring gear that costs less than 25 gp) for exorbitant prives (10x the list price).  Bildrath is self serving and is not interested in haggling - "All prices are best and final.  No haggling - you want, you pay!"  His nephew, Parpol "Parriwhimple" Cantemir (who is a large, strong but ultimately dumb young man) also works at the shop.

#### E2. Blood on the Vine Tavern
>A single shaft of light thrusts illumination into the main square, its brightness looking like a solid pillar in the heavy fog. Above the gaping doorway, a sign hangs precariously askew, proclaiming this to be the Blood on the Vine tavern.

##### NPCs
**Arik Lorensk**, or just Arik the Barkeep, is a small and pudgy little man who tends the bar of the tavern.  Mindlessly he cleans the glasses, one after another, starting over when he finishes the first.  He doesn't do much conversing, but if spoke to he will answer in a dull and hollow voice, basically taking drink orders before moving on to something else.
 
**Ismark Kolyanovich** sits in the bar, nursing a glass of Purple Grapesmash #3.  Today is the anniversary of his mother and father's death and it looms over him - putting him in a bad mood.  Of a regal, aristocratic bearing, Ismark will briefly fill in some of the blanks to his allies.

> "My father was burgomaster, my mother his beautiful bride.  They were happy, for a time.  But this place twists all that is good, and their love - that was good.  My mother - her name was Ireena - was said to resemble Katarina, Stradh's first love.  A love that was lost to him.  Stradh came for her.  He did not care for her wedding vows or for her maternal bonds.  He wished to possess her.  And he made his move.  My father - he was not a great warrior.  I am ten times the swordsman he was in his heyday - and he was not in his heyday by that time.  Stradh slew him first.  Then my mother fell upon my father's blade to spare her from the indignity of being Stradh's bride.  And so tonight I drink.  To remember them, and to forget what killed them."

Ismark is probably the friendliest face the party is going to see for awhile, and while he is not able to point them directly to the Amber Temple (if they ask) he does know that there is supposed to be some kind of repository of knowledge near Mount Ghakis.

**Queen of the Soil, Pure Forge and Pearl of the Forest Stream** are the three Vistani (tabaxi) proprietors of the Blood of the Vine Tavern.  The usually sit at a table by the door and keep an eye on things, making sure people pay their tabs and whatnot.  They are gossipy Mean Girl types, and pass judgment on all who enter.  If they see a Vistani (tabaxi) they will muse, wondering if the old fools had changed their mind, or decided they too were tired of living in horse manure.  Each has a small scar beneath their eye - a symbol of their status in the Vistani community.  They are considered *mortu* and have been exiled (and marked) for the crime of arranging the rape of one of their own kind two years ago.

#### E3. Mad Mary and Gertuda
Mad Mary, a crazy old woman, lives here with her daughter Gertuda.  Gertuda is kept inside by her mother, who is (understandably) paranoid about everything.

#### E4. Burgomaster's Mansion
> A weary-looking mansion squats behind a rusting iron fence. The iron gates are twisted and torn. The right gate lies cast aside, while the left swings lazily in the wind. The stuttering squeal and clang of the gate repeats with mindless precision. Weeds choke the grounds and press with menace upon the house itself.

Ismark's home.  Nothing of interest here, save pictures of Ismark's mother and father.

#### E5. The Church
> Atop a slight rise, against the roots of the pillar stone that supports Castle Ravenloft, stands a gray, sagging edifice of stone and wood. This church has obviously weathered the assaults of evil for centuries on end and is worn and weary. A bell tower rises toward the back, and flickering light shines through holes in the shingled roof. The rafters strain feebly against their load.

If the characters approach the church doors, add:  

> The heavy wooden doors of the church are covered with claw marks and scarred by fire.

The village priest, Donavich, lives here. Other Barov­ians shun the church for reasons that will quickly become obvious.  The following areas correspond to labels on the map of the church.

##### E5a. Hall
> The doors open to reveal a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-long hall leading to a brightly lit chapel. The hall is unlit and reeks of mildew. Four doors, two on each side of the hall, lead to adjacent chambers.  
>   
> You can see that the chapel is strewn with debris, and you hear a soft voice from within reciting a prayer. Suddenly, the prayer is blotted out by an inhuman scream that rises up from beneath the wooden floor.
  
The scream comes from the church’s undercroft (area E5g). The soft voice uttering the prayer belongs to Donavich, the priest (see area E5f).  
  
##### E5b. Doru’s Bedroom
> This dirty, lightless room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress. Mounted above the bed’s headboard is a wooden holy symbol.
  
This room once belonged to Doru, Donavich’s son, who is trapped in the undercroft (area E5g). It hasn’t been used in more than a year and contains nothing of value.  

##### E5c. Donavich’s Bedroom
> This dirty room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress, next to which rests a small table with an oil lamp burning brightly on it. Mounted above the bed’s headboard is a wooden sun-shaped holy symbol.

This is Donavich’s room and contains nothing of value.  

##### E5d. Trapdoor
> Time and neglect have punched holes in the ceiling of this moldy room, which contains a few broken roof shingles amid puddles of water. In one corner, set into the floor, is a heavy wooden trapdoor held shut with a chain and a padlock.  It is engraved - although engraved is perhaps not the right word, given the rough nature of the engraving - with all manner of sigils and symbols, prayers and mantras A young man’s screams of anguish can be heard through the door.

Donavich keeps his son Doru in the undercroft, unable to kill him but well aware of the monster Doru has become.  As the years have gone by Donavich has fed his son sparingly with his own blood, and has redoubled the wards and sigils on the trap door in the hopes of keeping his son down there.
  
##### E5e. Office
> An old desk and chair stand against the south wall, a wooden holy symbol mounted above them—a sunburst. A ten-foot-long iron rod attached to the north wall stands bare, suggesting a tapestry once hung there. Against the far wall stands a wooden cabinet with four tall doors.
  
An empty wooden poor box rests on the seat of the chair. The desk drawers contain a few sheets of blank parchment, along with a couple of quill pens and dried-up jars of ink.  
  
For its size, the wooden cabinet contains very little. Inside are a tinderbox, a few wooden boxes full of candles, and two well-used books: *Hymns to the Dawn*, a volume of prayers and chants dedicated to the worship of the Morninglord, and *The Blade of Truth: The Uses of Logic in the War Against Diabolist Heresies, as Fought by the Ulmist Inquisition*, a strange book that mixes logic exercises with lurid descriptions of fiend-worshiping cults.  Among the writings in that book there are several pages dedicated to the "Repository of Knowledge" located on Mount Ghakis.

##### E5f. Chapel
> The chapel is a shambles, with overturned and broken pews littering the dusty floor. Dozens of candles mounted in candlesticks and candelabras light every dusty corner in a fervent attempt to rid the chapel of shadows. At the far end of the church sits a claw-scarred altar, behind which kneels a priest in soiled vestments. Next to him hangs a long, thick rope that stretches up into the bell tower.
  
If the characters have not already entered the undercroft, add:  

> From beneath the chapel floor, you hear a young man’s voice cry out, “Father! I’m starving!”
  
Donavich has been praying throughout the night.  As he has every night for more than a year. His voice is hoarse and weak. He is, in a word, insane. A little more than a year ago, his twenty-year-old son Doru and several other villagers stormed Castle Ravenloft in a futile revolt.  There were few enough survivors, but those that returned confirmed that Doru had died.  And yet less than a week later he returned home.  Donavich is crazy, but he is not stupid.  He knows what his son is.  A monster.  But he cannot bring himself to kill his son.  Donavich was able to trap his son in the church’s undercroft, where he remains to this day.  
  
Doru has only been fed sparingly by his father since he was imprisoned, and he cries out at all hours. Meanwhile, Donavich prays day and night, hoping that the gods will tell him how to save Doru without destroying him. If the characters seem intent on slaying Doru, Donavich does his best to stop them. If Doru dies, Donavich falls to the floor and weeps inconsolably, overcome with despair.  

##### E5g. Undercroft
> The church’s undercroft has rough-hewn walls and a floor made of damp clay and earth. Rotting wooden pillars strain under the weight of the wooden ceiling. Candlelight from the chapel above slips though the cracks, allowing you to glimpse a gaunt shape in the far corner.

The shape is Doru, Donavich's son and a Vampire Warrior sent by Stradh to torment Donavich.  Doru is hungry, having only be fed sparingly by his father (ostensibly to keep him weak).  He will try to sneak out, rather than directly confront that party, but he will not hesitate to try and take a meal from them either.
  
#### E6. Cemetery
> A fence of wrought iron with a rusty gate encloses a rectangular plot of land behind the dilapidated church. Tightly packed gravestones shrouded by fog bear the names of souls long passed. All seems quiet.
  
During daytime, the cemetery is a still and peaceful place. Every night at midnight, however, a ghostly procession takes place (probably don't do this - it's stupid)

### Tser Pool Camp (Area G)
> The road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons.  
>
> The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river.  
>
> The upbeat strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad Vistani - tabaxi - around a bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forest’s edge.

There is little for the players to do here, but if they sit by the campfire they will opportunities to talk to the Vistani and find out about the world they are trapped in.  The Vistani know the following:
* Stradh is a powerful ruler, a god-king of sorts.  However he draws his power from someone or something else.  
* Vistani are not free, per se, but they have some liberty owing to some ancient agreement between the Vistani and Stradh when he was a mortal.  The Vistani are allowed to travel to and from Barovia, although they can never leave it behind forever.  
* The people of Barovia hate the Vistani for this freedom.  That is why Vistani mostly keep to themselves and stay out of the towns.
* There is a repository of ancient knowledge away to the south, near the snowy and shadowed peak of the Father of Storms, which Barovians call Mount Ghakis.  It is a forbidden place for the Vistani, but One of Life might know more.

If the players seek the Fortune Teller/Vistani Elder One of Life she will peer into their future:
* The party are, like the Vistani, not true prisoners of Ravenloft and the Dark Powers.  They are not part of it's endless cycle of forgotten hopes and shattered dreams.  Stradh keeps them here though, which is not much different
* The knowledge the party seeks is forbidden to the Vistani, part of their pact with Stradh.  It lies away to the south, in a place that is older than Stradh.  He went there one time - that is how he became ruler of the land, how he became imprisoned here.  The Vistani do not know more of what they might find there, but the path is straight - along the Svalich Road to Raven River, then south into the Tsolenka Pass.  Then climb the mountain road, to the Father of Storms, and to the knowledge they seek.
* One of Life will then offer to read the fortunes of the party.  Make up something for the party based on their histories and their path (Athas, Krynn, Oerth, Hell, Final Battles).  Then...

> As One of Life surveys the tarot a fearful look crosses her face.  "No... no this cannot be.  This is Stradh's domain!  It is... it is him!"

One of Life will panic, and if they party steps outside they will find the encampment under attack by servants of Vecna - 1 x Necromancer, 1 x Flind, 2 x Ogre Zombies, 4 x Gnoll Pack Lord.  Add others (low level gnolls and zombies) to deal with the Vistani, who are clearly not capable of fighting off this attack.  The party may try and save the Vistani, they may flee - let them make choices.  The aftermath will be bloody, however...

### Old Bonegrinder (Area O) 

#### Approach
> The Old Svalich Road transitions here from being a winding path through the Balinok Mountains to a lazy trail that hugs the mountainside as it descends into a fog-filled valley.  Further down in the valley you can make out the shadow of a walled town near the shores of a massive lake.  Near here the road splits, the branch climbing to a small promontory, atop which is perched a dilapidated stone windmill, its warped wooden vanes stripped bare.

If they investigate the windmill...

> The onion-domed edifice leans forward and to one side, as though trying to turn away from the stormy gray sky. You see gray brick walls and dirt-covered windows on the upper floors. A decrepit wooden platform encircles the windmill above a flimsy doorway leading to the building's interior. Perched on a wooden beam above the door is a raven. It hops about and squawks at you, seemingly agitated.

A character who pays attention to the bird and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check senses the raven is trying to warn the party.  Regardless, after it has delivered its message it flies away in the direction of the town in the valley below.  One at the windmill the party can look down into a forest in between the windmill and the town, and see four squat megaliths at the forest's edge.  Ravens can be seen circling in the air above the stones.

#### O1. Ground Floor
> The ground floor has been converted into a makeshift kitchen, but the room is filthy. Baskets and old dishware are piled everywhere. Adding to the clutter is a peddler's cart, a chicken coop, a heavy wooden trunk, and a pretty wooden cabinet with flowers painted on its doors. In addition to the clucking of the chickens, you hear toads croaking. 
>
> Warmth issues from a brick oven against one wall, and a crumbling staircase ascends the wall across from it. Shrieks and cackles from somewhere higher up cause the old mill to shudder.

The ceiling here is eight feet high.  If characters move into the room, they note the floor is littered with small bones.  If they make a DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check they recognize the bones as children's bones.

This room is filled with baking implements, including but not limited to: wooden bowls; rolling pins; various herbs and spices; flour; sugar and several gourds of an unknown white powder.  In one of the cupboards are three elixers - a magical one labelled "Youth" which makes the imbiber appear younger and more attractive for 24 hours; a non-magical one labelled "Laughter" which infects the imbibers with "Cackle Fever"; and a non-magical one labelled "Mother's Milk" which is actually a dose of "Pale Tincture".  Elsewhere a chicken coop contains several chickens and a rooster, as well as a few laid eggs and a wooden trunk that had tiny holes bored into its lid.  This contains a hundred or so croaking toads, some of which will escape if the lid is lifted.

If the players are being quiet then Morgantha remains ignorant of their presence upstairs, no roll necessary.  If they are not being quiet then Morgantha comes down to greet them.

#### O2. Bone Mill
> The dirt-caked windows of this room allow very little light to enter this eight foot high chamber, most of which is take up by a large millstone connected to a wooden gear shaft that rises through the ceiling in the centre of the room.  A stone staircase continues up, towards the sound of loud cackling...

Morgantha is here, unless she has been lured elsewhere.

#### O3. Bedroom
> A thick wooden gear shaft dominates this cramped, circular room.  A rotting wooden closet is here, with three crates stacked one atop of another, with small doors set into them.  Next to the closet is a heap of discarded clothing.  A ladder climbs to a wooden trapdoor in the night foot high ceiling.  A moldy bed with a tattered canopy stands nearby.

Morgantha's mother Offalia (another Blood Hag) and her daughter Bella (a Night Hag) are here, unless they have been lured elsewhere.

The crates, each of which is three cubic feet, are built to contain children.  The top crate is currently empty, but the middle and lower ones each have a child in them.  If Offalia and Bella are here they delight in torturing the children, pricking them and trying to make them cry.  Any attempt to free the children will incur the hag's wrath.

The outward facing side of each create is fitted with a small door that has an iron latch and iron hinges.  It can be unlatched and opened easily from the outside.

The two children are from the village of Barovia after being given to the hags by their parents in exchange for Dream Pastries.  The boy, Freek, is seven while the girl, Myrtle, is barely five.  The crates are full of crumbs as the hags have been fattening them up.  If freed neither wants to return to their homes, because of what their parents did.

The bed is not used for sleeping, but the hags store their treasure here.  The part can find ten pieces of cheap costume jewellery inside the mattress, each worth about 25 gp.

#### O4. Domed Attic
> You've reached the windmill's peak-a domed chamber filled with old machinery. There's not much room to move around. Light slips into this attic through small holes in the walls.

Characters searching this space find nothing more than a few old, abandoned bird's nests.

#### The Megaliths
The megaliths here were raised by the ancient peoples of Barovia, in in honour of the Three Ladies.  Each moss-covered stone bears a crude carving, representing a figure from the mythos - one is engraved with a raven, another with a spider and a third with a wolf.  The fourth has chaotic, unintelligible sigils etched into it.  Ravens circle overhead, and on the ground in the middle is a small pile of children's teeth - which the hags are using to weaken the natural order of Barovia for Stradh.   

Anyone with a passing familiarity with Barovian culture and history can make a DC 15 Intelligence (History or Religion) check to identify that three of the stones represent the Seeker (Raven), the Weaver (Spider) and the Huntress (Wolf) and that the fourth represent the Shadow - a forced opposed to the ladies.  

#### The Hags
Morgantha, Offalia and Bella are all hags, but usually disguise themselves.  The older two (Morgantha and Offalia) are Blood Hags while the younger one (Bella) is still just a night hag.  Morgantha is the "face" of their operation, and is happy to do business with anyone who shows up at her door.  However if folks are uninterested in what she is selling, or if they are too aggressive she will dismiss them - and then summon her family, if need be, to chase them off.

### Vallaki
#### Approaching the Town
>The Old Svalich Road meanders around the valley here, watched over by dark brooding mountains to the north and south.  The choking woods of the valley recede, revealing a sullen burg surrounded by a wooden palisade.  The thick fog of the valley presses against this wall, as if looking for a way inside - to catch the town aslumber.

As the party approaches the gate they will notice several eyes - and crossbows - trained on them.  One of the guards - armed with a pike - will step forward.

> "Halt and state your business here, or be gone..."

The question is simple.  Assuming the party responds with something that is straightforward enough the guard will not deny them admittance.

> "Very well.  You may enter the city.  As you are not from Vallaki, I will advise you of some important laws of the city.  The first - any mention of Strahd is strictly prohibited.  Know that even now as I say the name it is the last time you will hear it within these gates.  If you must mention that individual you are to refer to him simply as the Devil. "
>
> "The second - this noble town holds a weekly festival in honour of the resident's general merriment and the continued support of the burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich.  As guests of Vallaki, you will not be required to aid in the preparation for our festivals. However, your attendance and participation in each and every festival is absolutely mandatory for the length of your stay. Failure to attend will be in strict opposition to Vallakian law. The next great Vallakian festival, the Festival of the Blazing Sun, will be held tomorrow in the town square."
> 
> "The third - the high morale of this town is the source of its ability to stand up to the Devil.  While we understand you might not always feel in the best of spirits - especially as you come from beyond this safe and joyous place and will have to return to your home in time - it is best to hide those emotions away, lest they spread to others.  Harming the morale of the residents is considered a crime, and the punishment can be severe."
> 
> "Failure to comply with Vallakian Law will mark you as criminals in our city, and you will be punished in accordance with our justice system.  If you have any questions now is the time to ask them."

If the players have questions the guards possess the following information:
* On the laws of Vallaki: The guards will reiterate the law as many times as the players require.  If asked about their seemingly extreme nature they will say the festivals and the warm hearts of Vallaki have kept the devil at bay for more than a hundred years.  
* On the possible punishments: They range from fines and imprisonment to exile and to execution in some cases.  There is also a possibility of torture as the burgomaster is a sadist, but they do not mention that.
* On the festivals: The guards will expound their virtues, again reiterating the fact that the morale of the people has kept the people of Vallaki safe for a century.
* On where to stay: The Blue Water Inn is the only inn in town.
* On where to buy gear: Dragomir Ulbrek runs a smithy in town; the Henrik van der Voort, the coffin maker, is the town's best carpenter; Fatima Lukresh runs the tannery; the Alastroi siblings run Endless Delights Clothiers and Gadof Blinsky's for toys.

Once the players confirm they have no more questions the guards will call for a scribe and take a brief description of the party, along with their weapons.  Vallaki does not require visitors to go unarmed (after all, Barovia is a rough place) and they won't even get too mad if people try to lie or hide things (after all, Barovia is the kind of place that inspires paranoia) (DC 12 check to hide items, use false names etc).  

#### Around Town
##### General
The plan is for the players to pick up some cold weather gear to head into the mountains (remind them, if they haven't figured this out yet) and spend a couple evenings in town before heading out.  Refer to this [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8oj1qt/shops_in_vallaki/) for more information on the shops.  This can go lots of ways, but try to follow this basic outline - the players enter the town, get watched by Ernst Lanark, go to Endless Delights, get told to come back in two days (after the festival), go to the inn, get an invite by Lady Wachter, go to the festival the next day, get involved in the riot (maybe), fallout from riot/uprising, get clothes, continue on their path.

##### Being Watched
Shortly after entering town anyone with a passive perception of 14 or more will notice they are being watched by a pale, thin man with a hawkish nose and slicked back hair.  This is Lady Wachter's spy Ernst Lanark.  If confronted Lanark claims he keeps a watchful eye on all strangers.  If they threaten him he will back off, but he will not tell them anything about his purpose.  Once the party decide to leave him alone he will report back to Lady Wachter (they might follow him to find this out).

##### Endless Delights
Upon entering endless delights they will see the Alastroi siblings (Alek, Andrej, and Alana) hard at work - making things for tomorrow's festival.  They seem very busy, and if the party talks to them they might find out that the siblings are ecstatic about the constant festivals, since it keeps their pockets lined with gold.  If they party asks for winter gear the siblings will say they can get it for them - but they will have to wait until after the festival.

##### Blue Water Inn
The only inn in town, during the day only Urwin or his wife Danika are here.  During the evening there are other NPCs.  For their descriptions see below.  At some point during the day (assuming Ernst made is back to Lady Wachter) the party will get an invitation to attend a supper with Lady Wachter that evening.

Rooms cost five silver a night.  The inn also has food and drink available:

#### Morgantha's Dream Pies
Eating one of Morgantha's pies has one of the following effects:
* If eaten as a bonus action in combat you may add 1d4 to any attack roll or saving throw in the next minute.
* If eaten outside of combat it heals 2d4+2 hp
* If eaten before a long rest, you gain two extra hit dice to use during the next day.

However they are addictive.  The morning after you eat one roll a DC 10+2*(Total Number of Pies Eaten Lifetime) Constitution Save.  If they fail they become first level addicts:

*First Level Addict*: First level addict have a general -1 to all attack rolls and skill checks.  They can remedy this by eating a pie (but gain no other benefits from the pie except alleviating this).  If they go 24 hours without eating a pie, they lose this status.  Otherwise if they eat a pie during the day the next morning they must make a DC 12+2*(Total Number of Pies Eaten Lifetime) Constitution Save or progress to a second level addict.

*Second Level Addict*: Second level addicts have a level of exhaustion that can only be removed by eating a pie.  If they go 24 hours without eating a pie they drop to a First Level Addict.  Otherwise, if they eat a pie during the day they must make a DC 14+2*(Total Number of Pies Eaten Lifetime) Constitution saving throw or progress to a third level addict.

*Third Level Addict*: Third level addicts have two levels of exhaustion that can only be removed by eating a pie.  If they go 24 hours without eating a pie they may make a DC 15+2*(Total Number of Pies Eaten Lifetime) Constitution saving throw to drop to a second level addict. 

### Drink in Barovia
Almost all alcohol in Barovia is wine or wine-based, and almost all wine is made by the Martikov family (some is brought in by Vistani traders).  A description of the Martikov family wines is below:

#### Grapesmash
Grapesmash is the lowest grade of Martikov wine.  It is a red wine, made from grapes unfit for any other purpose.  It is, however, widely available.  Grapesmash wines tend to be tannin heavy and have a bitter, metallic aftertaste.  The Martikov's sell three types of Grapesmash wines - Grapesmash #3, which is purely made from Grapesmash grapes (and thus has the most pronounced Grapesmash 'flavour') and Grapesmash #2 & #1 - each of which uses progressively more of the Martikov's other grapes to dull the harsh edge of Grapesmash.
 
#### Dragoncrush
Dragoncrush is a red varietal from the Martikov winery.  They make two varieties of this varietal - Red Dragoncrush and Black Dragoncrush - as well as a brandy which is made from Red Dragoncrush called Dragon's Breath.  Red Dragoncrush uses dried grapes and is aged in oak barrels, giving it a spicy, cinnamony flavour.  Black Dragoncrush mixes fresh Dragoncrush grapes with Winterstomp grapes to give it a fresh, crisp flavour.  Dragon's Breath Brandy leans into the natural flavours of Red Dragoncrush, and is very spicy.  

#### Winterstomp
Winterstomp is a white varietal from the Martikov winery.  They are mainly used to balance the flavours of the Martikov Red varietals, as the grapes themselves are almost too acidic on their own.  The Martikov's do make a sparkling Winterstomp wine that is somewhat refreshing (if very acidic).
