# Caught by Stradh
## Setup
At the conclusion of their adventure into the Mournlands the party will have had the opportunity to gain one of the secrets needed to stabilize the cosmos.  Of course that was the easy one - the one Mordenkainen outlined in his thesis about the Tome of True Balance.

Fortunately the automata that are part of Mordenkainen's Bastion have been hard at work cataloguing data while the party is away (N-C4R-T4).  They have found another snippet of Mordenkainen's writings which leads them to the next step...

> The Domains of Dread.
>  
>  An interesting demiplane that seems to be co-terminus with every realm I have encountered in all the cosmos.  That seems interesting, but it does not seem stable enough - after all, the Orrey of the Planes allows me to travel to any realm I choose.  In some ways it too touches all other realms.  And I am hardly a master of planar travel.
>  
>  But there is something there I think.  Not the demiplane itself.  But the forces that style themselves its rulers.  I had the misfortune to be trapped in one not long ago.  One overseen by a petty tyrant named Stradh who styled himself some kind of god-king.  But I came to learn he was no god.  In a temple in that realm there was knowledge of things greater than Stradh.  Creatures that were keeping that monster a prisoner even as they granted him dominion over Barovia.  The so-called 'Dark Powers'.

>  I wish I had learned more then, but my mind was focused on my own escape. With the assistance of an odious dwarf who thought himself a holy man, but was clearly a sorcerer of some sort, a tabaxi and the reborn focus of Stradh's 'affection' we defeated Stradh - for a time at least.
>  
>  I do not relish the idea of going back there.  I could easily be trapped again.  But perhaps I do not need to.  The Domains of Dread hold many prisoners come petty tyrants.  And there is one amongst them who hates Vecna above all else.
