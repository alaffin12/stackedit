# Caught by Stradh
## Setup
At the conclusion of their adventure into the Mournlands the party will have had the opportunity to gain one of the secrets needed to stabilize the cosmos.  Of course that was the easy one - the one Mordenkainen outlined in his thesis about the Tome of True Balance.

Fortunately the automata that are part of Mordenkainen's Bastion have been hard at work cataloguing data while the party is away (N-C4R-T4).  They have found another snippet of Mordenkainen's writings which leads them to the next step...

> The Domains of Dread.
>  
>  An interesting demiplane that seems to be co-terminus with every realm I have encountered in all the cosmos.  That seems interesting, but it does not seem stable enough - after all, the Orrey of the Planes allows me to travel to any realm I choose.  In some ways it too touches all other realms.  And I am hardly a master of planar travel.
>  
>  But there is something there I think.  Not the demiplane itself.  But the forces that style themselves its rulers.  I had the misfortune to be trapped in one not long ago.  One overseen by a petty tyrant named Stradh who styled himself some kind of god-king.  But I came to learn he was no god.  In a temple in that realm there was knowledge of things greater than Stradh.  Creatures that were keeping that monster a prisoner even as they granted him dominion over Barovia.  The so-called 'Dark Powers'.  
>  
>  I wish I had learned more then, but my mind was focused on my own escape. With the assistance of an odious dwarf who thought himself a holy man, but was clearly a sorcerer of some sort, a tabaxi and the reborn focus of Stradh's 'affection' we defeated Stradh - for a time at least. I do not relish the idea of going back there.  I could easily be trapped again.  
>  
>  But perhaps I do not need to.  The Domains of Dread hold many prisoners who think themselves petty tyrants.  And there is one amongst them who hates Vecna above all else.  Kas the Betrayer.  Perhaps I should should make for Tovag, and find myself an ally - even if I will have to be on my guard with him.

Presumably they'll return to the Orrey and try and make their way to Tovag.  However as they do...

> You step into the portal formed by the Orrey, but instead of stepping out into the forested realm you had expected you step into inky blackness.
> 
> The space, if it can be called that - for it is more like an absence of space - is filled with countless voices that you cannot make out, but you can feel in your bones.  In your soul.  They scream at you.  They call you intruders.  Say you are working for the fugitive.  That you are here to free another prisoner.  You would fall to your knees in pain from the cacophony - if you had knees.  Like the voices you seem to only exist here as a voice.  A thought.
> 
> And then once voice silences all.  "You know, my masters, that I am always happy to take interesting playthings into my realm.  Send them to me, so they do not disturb you any further..."
>
> The void fades, and you wake up around the embers of a campfire as dawn is approaching.  But something inside of you feels off... the dawn is dull, grey.  Swallowed by clouds.  And you are somewhere you did not expect to be...

## Barovia
##### Notes of Barovia
One of the Demiplanes of Dread, Barovia is subject to the following rules:
* Supernatural mists surround Barovia and keep its prisoners imprisoned.  Anyone trying to leave Barovia gets lost in the mists and winds up back where they started - no exceptions (Stradh does frequently allow the Vistani to leave - but that is only by his parole, something he will not offer the players).
*  Stradh, being a vampire, is not terribly interested in having the sun shining in his realm.  As such, heavy cloud almost always obscures the sun, bathing the world in dim light that does not impact creatures who are affected by the sun.  Vampires still tend to be nocturnal though (easier hunting) and magic that causes sunlight does function as normal.
* Vistani is another name for Tabaxi in Barovia

Additionally, some magic functions differently:
* Any spell that would allow someone to escape the domain simply fails (after all, what good is a jail that can be escape with a plane shift).  This includes spells like banishment.  Simply put - what is in Barovia stays in Barovia unless Stradh or the Dark Powers get involved.
* Summoning spells fail for similar reasons, although spells that call familiars or companions do function - they simply call on local spirits and energies (as opposed to summoning a fire elemental from the elemental planes or a planetar from Celestia).
* Spells that utilize extra-dimensional spaces do function, but effects that would tear a hole in reality (putting a portable hole in a bag of holding for example) cause the same catastrophic effects, but do not create a hole in reality leading to the astral plane)
* Basically - there's no quick and easy escapes from the Domains of Dread.  If there was some of the characters imprisoned there (which once included Vecna) would easily escape. 
* Any magic that allows communications with entities on other planes is usable, with the proviso that Stradh can always (and does always) listen in on such communication, or if he wishes, he can redirect the call to himself and respond as if he were the entity being contacted.

### The Story as Planned
There is no intention for the players to play out the 'Curse of Stradh' as (a) the party are high enough level to trivialize most of the encounters and (b) the party are already in another adventure.  

Rather, upon awakening in the Svalich Woods and heading west (heading east brings them to the Gates of Barovia and the mists that keep prisoners in their cell) the party should know enough to make for the Amber Temple, to learn of their jailers (something they need to do to save the cosmos) and maybe find a means of escape.

The focus is going to be placed upon the locations in Barovia the players are likely to visit in the pursuit of this goal.  If they go off script you may have to improvise...

### The Village of Barovia (Area E)
The first place the players encounter as they head west is the village from which the land gets its name...

> A dense, unnatural mist clings to the crooked, rutted road as it winds into the heart of Barovia, a village suffocated by gloom. Sagging, decrepit houses lean toward the muddy streets, their shutters rattling in the cold wind like whispered warnings. The air is thick with damp rot, the scent of mildew and despair mingling with the faint iron tang of something fouler. The dim sunlight in this place barely punches through the broken windows, illuminating gaunt faces that vanish at the slightest movement. A church bell tolls weakly in the distance, its sound lost in the oppressive silence that blankets the village—a silence broken only by the occasional sob of an unseen mourner.

#### Unnamed Locations
If players visit an location that is not otherwise noted as being significant on the map they encounter on of the following inside the house: 

| d20 | Occupants |
| - | - |
| 1-3 | Empty |
| 4-8 | Rats! |
| 9-16 | Barovian Villagers |
| 17-20 | 4+2*1d4 Ghosts |

#### Entering Town
As the players enter town they meet Morgantha, a night hag disguised as a kindly old woman, exiting a house...

> You hear a door open and as your head snaps around to see the source of the noise you see a kindly looking old woman dressed in rags stepping out from inside.  She says something unheard to an occupant inside the house, turns and deposits a coin in a box she wears on her hip.  She moves to a nearby cart, looking over at you and smiling.  "Hm?  You're not from around here are you?  Could I interest you in one of my delicious hand pies?"

Morgantha is evil and works with her mother at the Old Bonegrinder windmill, stealing the souls of children to make her special pies.  However the pies do have useful magical properties (detailed below) and the party does not know Morgantha is evil yet.  Also as she is portraying a kindly (if somewhat shabby) old lady she will help the players with the following information:

* The only inn in town is the "Blood on the Vine" public house.  Calling it an inn is a stretch - it doesn't have rooms, just a common room with a hearth.  However it is warm, dry and safe at night.  
* The Blood on the Vine is owned by three Vistani women.  Morgantha doesn't know much about the women or about the Vistani in general
* The is a semi-permanent Vistani camp nearby as well, near the Tser Pool.  It's about four hours if you follow the road, on the other side of the Ivalis River.
* Stradh is a powerful ruler - the party should avoid crossing him if possible.
* Morgantha's pies are made by her and her mother.  They usually have potato and turnip filling, along with meat if they can get some from the hunters.  Wolf meat is most common (and is what she has today) owing to how common it is in Barovia.
* If asked why they are so expensive (a gold each) Morgantha will explain that her and her mother use a little bit of the old magic - something that has been passed down from mother to daughter through her family for a long time.  Anyone who eats one will have on the sweetest dreams that night.  Sadly, such things have to be done right to get the magic to work - and doing things right costs gold in Barovia.  "It's not like I can use the cheap cast offs the hunters give away cheap, or rotten old potatoes."

#### E1. Bildrath's Mercantile
>The sparse light from this building spills out from behind drawn heavy curtains. A sign over the door, creaking on its hinges, reads “Bildrath’s Mercantile.”

Bildrath Cantemir works a general store here.  It sells basic adventuring gear (everything from the PHB labelled adventuring gear that costs less than 25 gp) for exorbitant prives (10x the list price).  Bildrath is self serving and is not interested in haggling - "All prices are best and final.  No haggling - you want, you pay!"  His nephew, Parpol "Parriwhimple" Cantemir (who is a large, strong but ultimately dumb young man) also works at the shop.

#### E2. Blood on the Vine Tavern
>A single shaft of light thrusts illumination into the main square, its brightness looking like a solid pillar in the heavy fog. Above the gaping doorway, a sign hangs precariously askew, proclaiming this to be the Blood on the Vine tavern.

**Menu**
| Item | Price |
|--|--|
| *Breakfast* |  |
| Boiled Turnips | 6 cp |
| Grilled Lake Fish | Sold Out |
| *Lunch/Dinner* | |
| Adventurer's Steak w/Sauerkraut | 10 cp | 
| Toad & Beet Stew | 8 cp |
| *Drink* | |
| Purple Grapesmash #3 - Glass | 3 cp |  
| Purple Grapesmash #3 - Bottle | 20 cp |

Fish is always sold out here.  Adventurer's Steak is whatever meat the local hunters haul in.  The barkeep doesn't know and doesn't care to ask.  Everything is super salty.  

##### NPCs
**Arik Lorensk**, or just Arik the Barkeep, is a small and pudgy little man who tends the bar of the tavern.  Mindlessly he cleans the glasses, one after another, starting over when he finishes the first.  He doesn't do much conversing, but if spoke to he will answer in a dull and hollow voice, basically taking drink orders before moving on to something else.
 
**Ismark Kolyanovich** sits in the bar, nursing a glass of Purple Grapesmash #3.  Today is the anniversary of his mother and father's death and it looms over him - putting him in a bad mood.  Of a regal, aristocratic bearing, Ismark will briefly fill in some of the blanks to his allies.

> "My father was burgomaster, my mother his beautiful bride.  They were happy, for a time.  But this place twists all that is good, and their love - that was good.  My mother - her name was Ireena - was said to resemble Katarina, Stradh's first love.  A love that was lost to him.  Stradh came for her.  He did not care for her wedding vows or for her maternal bonds.  He wished to possess her.  And he made his move.  My father - he was not a great warrior.  I am ten times the swords man he was in his heyday - and he was not in his heyday by that time.  Stradh slew him first.  Then my mother fell upon my father's blade to spare her from the indignity of being Stradh's bride.  And so tonight I drink.  To remember them, and to forget what killed them."

Ismark is probably the friendliest face the party is going to see for awhile, and while he is not able to point them directly to the Amber Temple (if they ask) he does know that there is supposed to be some kind of repository of knowledge near Mount Ghakis.

**Queen of the Soil, Pure Forge and Pearl of the Forest Stream** are the three Vistani (tabaxi) proprietors of the Blood of the Vine Tavern.

### Foods in Barovia
#### Morgantha's Dream Pies
Eating one of Morgantha's pies has one of the following effects:
* If eaten as a bonus action in combat you may add 1d4 to any attack roll or saving throw in the next minute.
* If eaten outside of combat it heals 2d4+2 hp
* If eaten before a long rest, you gain two extra hit dice to use during the next day.

However they are addictive.  The morning after you eat one roll a DC 10+2*(Total Number of Pies Eaten Lifetime) Constitution Save.  If they fail they become first level addicts:

*First Level Addict*: First level addict have a general -1 to all attack rolls and skill checks.  They can remedy this by eating a pie (but gain no other benefits from the pie except alleviating this).  If they go 24 hours without eating a pie, they lose this status.  Otherwise if they eat a pie during the day the next morning they must make a DC 12+2*(Total Number of Pies Eaten Lifetime) Constitution Save or progress to a second level addict.

*Second Level Addict*: Second level addicts have a level of exhaustion that can only be removed by eating a pie.  If they go 24 hours without eating a pie they drop to a First Level Addict.  Otherwise, if they eat a pie during the day they m
### Drink in Barovia
Almost all alcohol in Barovia is wine or wine-based, and almost all wine is made by the Martikov family (some is brought in by Vistani traders).  A description of the Martikov family wines is below:

#### Grapesmash
Grapesmash is the lowest grade of Martikov wine.  It is a red wine, made from grapes unfit for any other purpose.  It is, however, widely available.  Grapesmash wines tend to be tannin heavy and have a bitter, metallic aftertaste.  The Martikov's sell three types of Grapesmash wines - Grapesmash #3, which is purely made from Grapesmash grapes (and thus has the most pronounced Grapesmash 'flavour') and Grapesmash #2 & #1 - each of which uses progressively more of the Martikov's other grapes to dull the harsh edge of Grapesmash.
 
#### Dragoncrush
Dragoncrush is a red varietal from the Martikov winery.  They make two varieties of this varietal - Red Dragoncrush and Black Dragoncrush - as well as a brandy which is made from Red Dragoncrush called Dragon's Breath.  Red Dragoncrush uses dried grapes and is aged in oak barrels, giving it a spicy, cinnamony flavour.  Black Dragoncrush mixes fresh Dragoncrush grapes with Winterstomp grapes to give it a fresh, crisp flavour.  Dragon's Breath Brandy leans into the natural flavours of Red Dragoncrush, and is very spicy.  

#### Winterstomp
Winterstomp is a white varietal from the Martikov winery.  They are mainly used to balance the flavours of the Martikov Red varietals, as the grapes themselves are almost too acidic on their own.  The Martikov's do make a sparkling Winterstomp wine that is somewhat refreshing (if very acidic).
