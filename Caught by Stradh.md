# Caught by Stradh
## Setup
At the conclusion of their adventure into the Mournlands the party will have had the opportunity to gain one of the secrets needed to stabilize the cosmos.  Of course that was the easy one - the one Mordenkainen outlined in his thesis about the Tome of True Balance.

Fortunately the automata that are part of Mordenkainen's Bastion have been hard at work cataloguing data while the party is away (N-C4R-T4).  They have found another snippet of Mordenkainen's writings which leads them to the next step...

> The Domains of Dread.
>  
>  An interesting demiplane that seems to be co-terminus with every realm I have encountered in all the cosmos.  That seems interesting, but it does not seem stable enough - after all, the Orrey of the Planes allows me to travel to any realm I choose.  In some ways it too touches all other realms.  And I am hardly a master of planar travel.
>  
>  But there is something there I think.  Not the demiplane itself.  But the forces that style themselves its rulers.  I had the misfortune to be trapped in one not long ago.  One overseen by a petty tyrant named Stradh who styled himself some kind of god-king.  But I came to learn he was no god.  In a temple in that realm there was knowledge of things greater than Stradh.  Creatures that were keeping that monster a prisoner even as they granted him dominion over Barovia.  The so-called 'Dark Powers'.  
>  
>  I wish I had learned more then, but my mind was focused on my own escape. With the assistance of an odious dwarf who thought himself a holy man, but was clearly a sorcerer of some sort, a tabaxi and the reborn focus of Stradh's 'affection' we defeated Stradh - for a time at least. I do not relish the idea of going back there.  I could easily be trapped again.  
>  
>  But perhaps I do not need to.  The Domains of Dread hold many prisoners who think themselves petty tyrants.  And there is one amongst them who hates Vecna above all else.  Kas the Betrayer.  Perhaps I should should make for Tovag, and find myself an ally - even if I will have to be on my guard with him.

Presumably they'll return to the Orrey and try and make their way to Tovag.  However as they do...

> You step into the portal formed by the Orrey, but instead of stepping out into the forested realm you had expected you step into inky blackness.
> 
> The space, if it can be called that - for it is more like an absence of space - is filled with countless voices that you cannot make out, but you can feel in your bones.  In your soul.  They scream at you.  They call you intruders.  Say you are working for the fugitive.  That you are here to free another prisoner.  You would fall to your knees in pain from the cacophony - if you had knees.  Like the voices you seem to only exist here as a voice.  A thought.
> 
> And then once voice silences all.  "You know, my masters, that I am always happy to take interesting playthings into my realm.  Send them to me, so they do not disturb you any further..."
>
> The void fades, and you wake up around the embers of a campfire as dawn is approaching.  But something inside of you feels off... the dawn is dull, grey.  Swallowed by clouds.  And you are somewhere you did not expect to be...

## Barovia
##### Notes of Barovia
One of the Demiplanes of Dread, Barovia is subject to the following rules:
* Supernatural mists surround Barovia and keep its prisoners imprisoned.  Anyone trying to leave Barovia gets lost in the mists and winds up back where they started - no exceptions (Stradh does frequently allow the Vistani to leave - but that is only by his parole, something he will not offer the players).
*  Stradh, being a vampire, is not terribly interested in having the sun shining in his realm.  As such, heavy cloud almost always obscures the sun, bathing the world in dim light that does not impact creatures who are affected by the sun.  Vampires still tend to be nocturnal though (easier hunting) and magic that causes sunlight does function as normal.
* Vistani is another name for Tabaxi in Barovia

Additionally, some magic functions differently:
* Any spell that would allow someone to escape the domain simply fails (after all, what good is a jail that can be escape with a plane shift).  This includes spells like banishment.  Simply put - what is in Barovia stays in Barovia unless Stradh or the Dark Powers get involved.
* Summoning spells fail for similar reasons, although spells that call familiars or companions do function - they simply call on local spirits and energies (as opposed to summoning a fire elemental from the elemental planes or a planetar from Celestia).
* Spells that utilize extra-dimensional spaces do function, but effects that would tear a hole in reality (putting a portable hole in a bag of holding for example) cause the same catastrophic effects, but do not create a hole in reality leading to the astral plane)
* Basically - there's no quick and easy escapes from the Domains of Dread.  If there was some of the characters imprisoned there (which once included Vecna) would easily escape. 
* Any magic that allows communications with entities on other planes is usable, with the proviso that Stradh can always (and does always) listen in on such communication, or if he wishes, he can redirect the call to himself and respond as if he were the entity being contacted.

### The Story as Planned
There is no intention for the players to play out the 'Curse of Stradh' as (a) the party are high enough level to trivialize most of the encounters and (b) the party are already in another adventure.  

Rather, upon awakening in the Svalich Woods and heading west (heading east brings them to the Gates of Barovia and the mists that keep prisoners in their cell) the party should know enough to make for the Amber Temple, to learn of their jailers (something they need to do to save the cosmos) and maybe find a means of escape.

The focus is going to be placed upon the locations in Barovia the players are likely to visit in the pursuit of this goal.  If they go off script you may have to improvise...

### The Village of Barovia (Area E)
The first place the players encounter as they head west is the village from which the land gets its name...

> A dense, unnatural mist clings to the crooked, rutted road as it winds into the heart of Barovia, a village suffocated by gloom. Sagging, decrepit houses lean toward the muddy streets, their shutters rattling in the cold wind like whispered warnings. The air is thick with damp rot, the scent of mildew and despair mingling with the faint iron tang of something fouler. The dim sunlight in this place barely punches through the broken windows, illuminating gaunt faces that vanish at the slightest movement. A church bell tolls weakly in the distance, its sound lost in the oppressive silence that blankets the village—a silence broken only by the occasional sob of an unseen mourner.

#### Unnamed Locations
If players visit an location that is not otherwise noted as being significant on the map they encounter on of the following inside the house: 

| d20 | Occupants |
| - | - |
| 1-3 | Empty |
| 4-8 | Rats! |
| 9-16 | Barovian Villagers |
| 17-20 | 4+2*1d4 Ghosts |

#### Entering Town
As the players enter town they meet Morgantha, a blood hag disguised as a kindly old woman, exiting a house...

> You hear a door open and as your head snaps around to see the source of the noise you see a kindly looking old woman dressed in rags stepping out from inside.  She says something unheard to an occupant inside the house, turns and deposits a coin in a box she wears on her hip.  She moves to a nearby cart, looking over at you and smiling.  "Hm?  You're not from around here are you?  Could I interest you in one of my delicious hand pies?"

Morgantha is evil and works with her mother and daughter at the Old Bonegrinder windmill, stealing the souls of children to make her special pies.  However the pies do have useful magical properties (detailed below) and the party does not know Morgantha is evil yet.  Also as she is portraying a kindly (if somewhat shabby) old lady she will help the players with the following information:

* The only inn in town is the "Blood on the Vine" public house.  Calling it an inn is a stretch - it doesn't have rooms, just a common room with a hearth.  However it is warm, dry and safe at night.  
* The Blood on the Vine is owned by three Vistani women.  Morgantha doesn't know much about the women or about the Vistani in general
* The is a semi-permanent Vistani camp nearby as well, near the Tser Pool.  It's about four hours if you follow the road, on the other side of the Ivalis River.
* Stradh is a powerful ruler - the party should avoid crossing him if possible.
* Morgantha's pies are made by her and her mother.  They usually have potato and turnip filling, along with meat if they can get some from the hunters.  Wolf meat is most common (and is what she has today) owing to how common it is in Barovia.
* If asked why they are so expensive (a gold each) Morgantha will explain that her, her daughter and her mother use a little bit of the old magic - something that has been passed down from mother to daughter through her family for a long time.  Anyone who eats one will have on the sweetest dreams that night.  Sadly, such things have to be done right to get the magic to work - and doing things right costs gold in Barovia.  "It's not like I can use the cheap cast offs the hunters give away cheap, or rotten old potatoes."

#### E1. Bildrath's Mercantile
>The sparse light from this building spills out from behind drawn heavy curtains. A sign over the door, creaking on its hinges, reads “Bildrath’s Mercantile.”

Bildrath Cantemir works a general store here.  It sells basic adventuring gear (everything from the PHB labelled adventuring gear that costs less than 25 gp) for exorbitant prives (10x the list price).  Bildrath is self serving and is not interested in haggling - "All prices are best and final.  No haggling - you want, you pay!"  His nephew, Parpol "Parriwhimple" Cantemir (who is a large, strong but ultimately dumb young man) also works at the shop.

#### E2. Blood on the Vine Tavern
>A single shaft of light thrusts illumination into the main square, its brightness looking like a solid pillar in the heavy fog. Above the gaping doorway, a sign hangs precariously askew, proclaiming this to be the Blood on the Vine tavern.

##### NPCs
**Arik Lorensk**, or just Arik the Barkeep, is a small and pudgy little man who tends the bar of the tavern.  Mindlessly he cleans the glasses, one after another, starting over when he finishes the first.  He doesn't do much conversing, but if spoke to he will answer in a dull and hollow voice, basically taking drink orders before moving on to something else.
 
**Ismark Kolyanovich** sits in the bar, nursing a glass of Purple Grapesmash #3.  Today is the anniversary of his mother and father's death and it looms over him - putting him in a bad mood.  Of a regal, aristocratic bearing, Ismark will briefly fill in some of the blanks to his allies.

> "My father was burgomaster, my mother his beautiful bride.  They were happy, for a time.  But this place twists all that is good, and their love - that was good.  My mother - her name was Ireena - was said to resemble Katarina, Stradh's first love.  A love that was lost to him.  Stradh came for her.  He did not care for her wedding vows or for her maternal bonds.  He wished to possess her.  And he made his move.  My father - he was not a great warrior.  I am ten times the swordsman he was in his heyday - and he was not in his heyday by that time.  Stradh slew him first.  Then my mother fell upon my father's blade to spare her from the indignity of being Stradh's bride.  And so tonight I drink.  To remember them, and to forget what killed them."

Ismark is probably the friendliest face the party is going to see for awhile, and while he is not able to point them directly to the Amber Temple (if they ask) he does know that there is supposed to be some kind of repository of knowledge near Mount Ghakis.

**Queen of the Soil, Pure Forge and Pearl of the Forest Stream** are the three Vistani (tabaxi) proprietors of the Blood of the Vine Tavern.  The usually sit at a table by the door and keep an eye on things, making sure people pay their tabs and whatnot.  They are gossipy Mean Girl types, and pass judgment on all who enter.  If they see a Vistani (tabaxi) they will muse, wondering if the old fools had changed their mind, or decided they too were tired of living in horse manure.  Each has a small scar beneath their eye - a symbol of their status in the Vistani community.  They are considered *mortu* and have been exiled (and marked) for the crime of arranging the rape of one of their own kind two years ago.

#### E3. Mad Mary and Gertuda
Mad Mary, a crazy old woman, lives here with her daughter Gertuda.  Gertuda is kept inside by her mother, who is (understandably) paranoid about everything.

#### E4. Burgomaster's Mansion
> A weary-looking mansion squats behind a rusting iron fence. The iron gates are twisted and torn. The right gate lies cast aside, while the left swings lazily in the wind. The stuttering squeal and clang of the gate repeats with mindless precision. Weeds choke the grounds and press with menace upon the house itself.

Ismark's home.  Nothing of interest here, save pictures of Ismark's mother and father.

#### E5. The Church
> Atop a slight rise, against the roots of the pillar stone that supports Castle Ravenloft, stands a gray, sagging edifice of stone and wood. This church has obviously weathered the assaults of evil for centuries on end and is worn and weary. A bell tower rises toward the back, and flickering light shines through holes in the shingled roof. The rafters strain feebly against their load.

If the characters approach the church doors, add:  

> The heavy wooden doors of the church are covered with claw marks and scarred by fire.

The village priest, Donavich, lives here. Other Barov­ians shun the church for reasons that will quickly become obvious.  The following areas correspond to labels on the map of the church.

##### E5a. Hall
> The doors open to reveal a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-long hall leading to a brightly lit chapel. The hall is unlit and reeks of mildew. Four doors, two on each side of the hall, lead to adjacent chambers.  
>   
> You can see that the chapel is strewn with debris, and you hear a soft voice from within reciting a prayer. Suddenly, the prayer is blotted out by an inhuman scream that rises up from beneath the wooden floor.
  
The scream comes from the church’s undercroft (area E5g). The soft voice uttering the prayer belongs to Donavich, the priest (see area E5f).  
  
##### E5b. Doru’s Bedroom
> This dirty, lightless room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress. Mounted above the bed’s headboard is a wooden holy symbol.
  
This room once belonged to Doru, Donavich’s son, who is trapped in the undercroft (area E5g). It hasn’t been used in more than a year and contains nothing of value.  

##### E5c. Donavich’s Bedroom
> This dirty room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress, next to which rests a small table with an oil lamp burning brightly on it. Mounted above the bed’s headboard is a wooden sun-shaped holy symbol.

This is Donavich’s room and contains nothing of value.  

##### E5d. Trapdoor
> Time and neglect have punched holes in the ceiling of this moldy room, which contains a few broken roof shingles amid puddles of water. In one corner, set into the floor, is a heavy wooden trapdoor held shut with a chain and a padlock.  It is engraved - although engraved is perhaps not the right word, given the rough nature of the engraving - with all manner of sigils and symbols, prayers and mantras A young man’s screams of anguish can be heard through the door.

Donavich keeps his son Doru in the undercroft, unable to kill him but well aware of the monster Doru has become.  As the years have gone by Donavich has fed his son sparingly with his own blood, and has redoubled the wards and sigils on the trap door in the hopes of keeping his son down there.
  
##### E5e. Office
> An old desk and chair stand against the south wall, a wooden holy symbol mounted above them—a sunburst. A ten-foot-long iron rod attached to the north wall stands bare, suggesting a tapestry once hung there. Against the far wall stands a wooden cabinet with four tall doors.
  
An empty wooden poor box rests on the seat of the chair. The desk drawers contain a few sheets of blank parchment, along with a couple of quill pens and dried-up jars of ink.  
  
For its size, the wooden cabinet contains very little. Inside are a tinderbox, a few wooden boxes full of candles, and two well-used books: *Hymns to the Dawn*, a volume of prayers and chants dedicated to the worship of the Morninglord, and *The Blade of Truth: The Uses of Logic in the War Against Diabolist Heresies, as Fought by the Ulmist Inquisition*, a strange book that mixes logic exercises with lurid descriptions of fiend-worshiping cults.  Among the writings in that book there are several pages dedicated to the "Repository of Knowledge" located on Mount Ghakis.

##### E5f. Chapel
> The chapel is a shambles, with overturned and broken pews littering the dusty floor. Dozens of candles mounted in candlesticks and candelabras light every dusty corner in a fervent attempt to rid the chapel of shadows. At the far end of the church sits a claw-scarred altar, behind which kneels a priest in soiled vestments. Next to him hangs a long, thick rope that stretches up into the bell tower.
  
If the characters have not already entered the undercroft, add:  

> From beneath the chapel floor, you hear a young man’s voice cry out, “Father! I’m starving!”
  
Donavich has been praying throughout the night.  As he has every night for more than a year. His voice is hoarse and weak. He is, in a word, insane. A little more than a year ago, his twenty-year-old son Doru and several other villagers stormed Castle Ravenloft in a futile revolt.  There were few enough survivors, but those that returned confirmed that Doru had died.  And yet less than a week later he returned home.  Donavich is crazy, but he is not stupid.  He knows what his son is.  A monster.  But he cannot bring himself to kill his son.  Donavich was able to trap his son in the church’s undercroft, where he remains to this day.  
  
Doru has only been fed sparingly by his father since he was imprisoned, and he cries out at all hours. Meanwhile, Donavich prays day and night, hoping that the gods will tell him how to save Doru without destroying him. If the characters seem intent on slaying Doru, Donavich does his best to stop them. If Doru dies, Donavich falls to the floor and weeps inconsolably, overcome with despair.  

##### E5g. Undercroft
> The church’s undercroft has rough-hewn walls and a floor made of damp clay and earth. Rotting wooden pillars strain under the weight of the wooden ceiling. Candlelight from the chapel above slips though the cracks, allowing you to glimpse a gaunt shape in the far corner.

The shape is Doru, Donavich's son and a Vampire Warrior sent by Stradh to torment Donavich.  Doru is hungry, having only be fed sparingly by his father (ostensibly to keep him weak).  He will try to sneak out, rather than directly confront that party, but he will not hesitate to try and take a meal from them either.
  
#### E6. Cemetery
> A fence of wrought iron with a rusty gate encloses a rectangular plot of land behind the dilapidated church. Tightly packed gravestones shrouded by fog bear the names of souls long passed. All seems quiet.
  
During daytime, the cemetery is a still and peaceful place. Every night at midnight, however, a ghostly procession takes place (probably don't do this - it's stupid)

### Tser Pool Camp (Area G)
> The road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons.  
>
> The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river.  
>
> The upbeat strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad Vistani - tabaxi - around a bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forest’s edge.

There is little for the players to do here, but if they sit by the campfire they will opportunities to talk to the Vistani and find out about the world they are trapped in.  The Vistani know the following:
* Stradh is a powerful ruler, a god-king of sorts.  However he draws his power from someone or something else.  
* Vistani are not free, per se, but they have some liberty owing to some ancient agreement between the Vistani and Stradh when he was a mortal.  The Vistani are allowed to travel to and from Barovia, although they can never leave it behind forever.  
* The people of Barovia hate the Vistani for this freedom.  That is why Vistani mostly keep to themselves and stay out of the towns.
* There is a repository of ancient knowledge away to the south, near the snowy and shadowed peak of the Father of Storms, which Barovians call Mount Ghakis.  It is a forbidden place for the Vistani, but One of Life might know more.

If the players seek the Fortune Teller/Vistani Elder One of Life she will peer into their future:
* The party are, like the Vistani, not true prisoners of Ravenloft and the Dark Powers.  They are not part of it's endless cycle of forgotten hopes and shattered dreams.  Stradh keeps them here though, which is not much different
* The knowledge the party seeks is forbidden to the Vistani, part of their pact with Stradh.  It lies away to the south, in a place that is older than Stradh.  He went there one time - that is how he became ruler of the land, how he became imprisoned here.  The Vistani do not know more of what they might find there, but the path is straight - along the Svalich Road to Raven River, then south into the Tsolenka Pass.  Then climb the mountain road, to the Father of Storms, and to the knowledge they seek.
* One of Life will then offer to read the fortunes of the party.  Make up something for the party based on their histories and their path (Athas, Krynn, Oerth, Hell, Final Battles).  Then...

> As One of Life surveys the tarot a fearful look crosses her face.  "No... no this cannot be.  This is Stradh's domain!  It is... it is him!"

One of Life will panic, and if they party steps outside they will find the encampment under attack by servants of Vecna - 1 x Necromancer, 1 x Flind, 2 x Ogre Zombies, 4 x Gnoll Pack Lord.  Add others (low level gnolls and zombies) to deal with the Vistani, who are clearly not capable of fighting off this attack.  The party may try and save the Vistani, they may flee - let them make choices.  The aftermath will be bloody, however...

### Old Bonegrinder (Area O) 

#### Approach
> The Old Svalich Road transitions here from being a winding path through the Balinok Mountains to a lazy trail that hugs the mountainside as it descends into a fog-filled valley.  Further down in the valley you can make out the shadow of a walled town near the shores of a massive lake.  Near here the road splits, the branch climbing to a small promontory, atop which is perched a dilapidated stone windmill, its warped wooden vanes stripped bare.

If they investigate the windmill...

> The onion-domed edifice leans forward and to one side, as though trying to turn away from the stormy gray sky. You see gray brick walls and dirt-covered windows on the upper floors. A decrepit wooden platform encircles the windmill above a flimsy doorway leading to the building's interior. Perched on a wooden beam above the door is a raven. It hops about and squawks at you, seemingly agitated.

A character who pays attention to the bird and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check senses the raven is trying to warn the party.  Regardless, after it has delivered its message it flies away in the direction of the town in the valley below.  One at the windmill the party can look down into a forest in between the windmill and the town, and see four squat megaliths at the forest's edge.  Ravens can be seen circling in the air above the stones.

#### O1. Ground Floor
> The ground floor has been converted into a makeshift kitchen, but the room is filthy. Baskets and old dishware are piled everywhere. Adding to the clutter is a peddler's cart, a chicken coop, a heavy wooden trunk, and a pretty wooden cabinet with flowers painted on its doors. In addition to the clucking of the chickens, you hear toads croaking. 
>
> Warmth issues from a brick oven against one wall, and a crumbling staircase ascends the wall across from it. Shrieks and cackles from somewhere higher up cause the old mill to shudder.

The ceiling here is eight feet high.  If characters move into the room, they note the floor is littered with small bones.  If they make a DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check they recognize the bones as children's bones.

This room is filled with baking implements, including but not limited to: wooden bowls; rolling pins; various herbs and spices; flour; sugar and several gourds of an unknown white powder.  In one of the cupboards are three elixers - a magical one labelled "Youth" which makes the imbiber appear younger and more attractive for 24 hours; a non-magical one labelled "Laughter" which infects the imbibers with "Cackle Fever"; and a non-magical one labelled "Mother's Milk" which is actually a dose of "Pale Tincture".  Elsewhere a chicken coop contains several chickens and a rooster, as well as a few laid eggs and a wooden trunk that had tiny holes bored into its lid.  This contains a hundred or so croaking toads, some of which will escape if the lid is lifted.

If the players are being quiet then Morgantha remains ignorant of their presence upstairs, no roll necessary.  If they are not being quiet then Morgantha comes down to greet them.

#### O2. Bone Mill
> The dirt-caked windows of this room allow very little light to enter this eight foot high chamber, most of which is take up by a large millstone connected to a wooden gear shaft that rises through the ceiling in the centre of the room.  A stone staircase continues up, towards the sound of loud cackling...

Morgantha is here, unless she has been lured elsewhere.

#### O3. Bedroom
> A thick wooden gear shaft dominates this cramped, circular room.  A rotting wooden closet is here, with three crates stacked one atop of another, with small doors set into them.  Next to the closet is a heap of discarded clothing.  A ladder climbs to a wooden trapdoor in the night foot high ceiling.  A moldy bed with a tattered canopy stands nearby.

Morgantha's mother Offalia (another Blood Hag) and her daughter Bella (a Night Hag) are here, unless they have been lured elsewhere.

The crates, each of which is three cubic feet, are built to contain children.  The top crate is currently empty, but the middle and lower ones each have a child in them.  If Offalia and Bella are here they delight in torturing the children, pricking them and trying to make them cry.  Any attempt to free the children will incur the hag's wrath.

The outward facing side of each create is fitted with a small door that has an iron latch and iron hinges.  It can be unlatched and opened easily from the outside.

The two children are from the village of Barovia after being given to the hags by their parents in exchange for Dream Pastries.  The boy, Freek, is seven while the girl, Myrtle, is barely five.  The crates are full of crumbs as the hags have been fattening them up.  If freed neither wants to return to their homes, because of what their parents did.

The bed is not used for sleeping, but the hags store their treasure here.  The part can find ten pieces of cheap costume jewellery inside the mattress, each worth about 25 gp.

#### O4. Domed Attic
> You've reached the windmill's peak-a domed chamber filled with old machinery. There's not much room to move around. Light slips into this attic through small holes in the walls.

Characters searching this space find nothing more than a few old, abandoned bird's nests.

#### The Megaliths
The megaliths here were raised by the ancient peoples of Barovia, in in honour of the Three Ladies.  Each moss-covered stone bears a crude carving, representing a figure from the mythos - one is engraved with a raven, another with a spider and a third with a wolf.  The fourth has chaotic, unintelligible sigils etched into it.  Ravens circle overhead, and on the ground in the middle is a small pile of children's teeth - which the hags are using to weaken the natural order of Barovia for Stradh.   

Anyone with a passing familiarity with Barovian culture and history can make a DC 15 Intelligence (History or Religion) check to identify that three of the stones represent the Seeker (Raven), the Weaver (Spider) and the Huntress (Wolf) and that the fourth represent the Shadow - a forced opposed to the ladies.  

#### The Hags
Morgantha, Offalia and Bella are all hags, but usually disguise themselves.  The older two (Morgantha and Offalia) are Blood Hags while the younger one (Bella) is still just a night hag.  Morgantha is the "face" of their operation, and is happy to do business with anyone who shows up at her door.  However if folks are uninterested in what she is selling, or if they are too aggressive she will dismiss them - and then summon her family, if need be, to chase them off.

### Vallaki
#### Approaching the Town
>The Old Svalich Road meanders around the valley here, watched over by dark brooding mountains to the north and south.  The choking woods of the valley recede, revealing a sullen burg surrounded by a wooden palisade.  The thick fog of the valley presses against this wall, as if looking for a way inside - to catch the town aslumber.

As the party approaches the gate they will notice several eyes - and crossbows - trained on them.  One of the guards - armed with a pike - will step forward.

> "Halt and state your business here, or be gone..."

The question is simple.  Assuming the party responds with something that is straightforward enough the guard will not deny them admittance.

> "Very well.  You may enter the city.  As you are not from Vallaki, I will advise you of some important laws of the city.  The first - any mention of Strahd is strictly prohibited.  Know that even now as I say the name it is the last time you will hear it within these gates.  If you must mention that individual you are to refer to him simply as the Devil. "
>
> "The second - this noble town holds a weekly festival in honour of the resident's general merriment and the continued support of the burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich.  As guests of Vallaki, you will not be required to aid in the preparation for our festivals. However, your attendance and participation in each and every festival is absolutely mandatory for the length of your stay. Failure to attend will be in strict opposition to Vallakian law. The next great Vallakian festival, the Festival of the Blazing Sun, will be held tomorrow in the town square."
> 
> "The third - the high morale of this town is the source of its ability to stand up to the Devil.  While we understand you might not always feel in the best of spirits - especially as you come from beyond this safe and joyous place and will have to return to your home in time - it is best to hide those emotions away, lest they spread to others.  Harming the morale of the residents is considered a crime, and the punishment can be severe."
> 
> "Failure to comply with Vallakian Law will mark you as criminals in our city, and you will be punished in accordance with our justice system.  If you have any questions now is the time to ask them."

If the players have questions the guards possess the following information:
* On the laws of Vallaki: The guards will reiterate the law as many times as the players require.  If asked about their seemingly extreme nature they will say the festivals and the warm hearts of Vallaki have kept the devil at bay for more than a hundred years.  
* On the possible punishments: They range from fines and imprisonment to exile and to execution in some cases.  There is also a possibility of torture as the burgomaster is a sadist, but they do not mention that.
* On the festivals: The guards will expound their virtues, again reiterating the fact that the morale of the people has kept the people of Vallaki safe for a century.
* On where to stay: The Blue Water Inn is the only inn in town.
* On where to buy gear: Dragomir Ulbrek runs a smithy in town; the Henrik van der Voort, the coffin maker, is the town's best carpenter; Fatima Lukresh runs the tannery; the Alastroi siblings run Endless Delights Clothiers and Gadof Blinsky's for toys.

Once the players confirm they have no more questions the guards will call for a scribe and take a brief description of the party, along with their weapons.  Vallaki does not require visitors to go unarmed (after all, Barovia is a rough place) and they won't even get too mad if people try to lie or hide things (after all, Barovia is the kind of place that inspires paranoia) (DC 12 check to hide items, use false names etc).  

#### Around Town
##### General
The plan is for the players to pick up some cold weather gear to head into the mountains (remind them, if they haven't figured this out yet) and spend a couple evenings in town before heading out.  Refer to this [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8oj1qt/shops_in_vallaki/) for more information on the shops.  This can go lots of ways, but try to follow this basic outline - the players enter the town, get watched by Ernst Lanark, go to Endless Delights, get told to come back in two days (after the festival), go to the inn, get an invite by Lady Wachter, go to the festival the next day, get involved in the riot (maybe), fallout from riot/uprising, get clothes, continue on their path.

##### Being Watched
Shortly after entering town anyone with a passive perception of 14 or more will notice they are being watched by a pale, thin man with a hawkish nose and slicked back hair.  This is Lady Wachter's spy Ernst Lanark.  If confronted Lanark claims he keeps a watchful eye on all strangers.  If they threaten him he will back off, but he will not tell them anything about his purpose.  Once the party decide to leave him alone he will report back to Lady Wachter (they might follow him to find this out).

##### Endless Delights
Upon entering endless delights they will see the Alastroi siblings (Alek, Andrej, and Alana) hard at work - making things for tomorrow's festival.  They seem very busy, and if the party talks to them they might find out that the siblings are ecstatic about the constant festivals, since it keeps their pockets lined with gold.  If they party asks for winter gear the siblings will say they can get it for them - but they will have to wait until after the festival.

##### Blue Water Inn
The only inn in town, during the day only Urwin or his wife Danika are here.  During the evening there are other NPCs.  For their descriptions see below.  At some point during the day (assuming Ernst made is back to Lady Wachter) the party will get an invitation to attend a supper with Lady Wachter that evening.

Rooms cost five silver a night.  The inn also has food and drink available:

**NPCs**
*The Martikovs*: Urwin and his wife Danika are the owners of the Inn and are usually seen splitting their time between the tavern area and the kitchen.  Their young sons Brom and Bray are also often present.  Urwin can be prickly and difficult to deal with.  Danika is more friendly, but she still has a proud and noble bearing and does not suffer fools.  The two boys are 11 and 9 and are typical boys of that age (except that all are wereravens and Urwin and Danika are members of the Keepers of the Feather).

*The Hunters*: Szoldar Szoldarovich and Yevgeni Krushkin are two grim and dour hunters who frequent the tavern.  They don't have much to say and tend to keep to themselves.  If asked they will happily guide the party to the Amber Temple - so long as they pay them 500 gp apiece.  Half upfront.  No haggling.  If they want better directions (or some kind of advice) they provide it for drinks.

*The Wachters*: Nikolai and Karl are the sons of Lady Wachter.  They are brash drunkards and always looking for trouble - but they know better than to pick fights with well-armed strangers.  They are not privy to their mother's plans (she doesn't trust them) nor do they attend her dinner.

##### Wachterhaus
For the next step the players are invited to dinner at Wachterhaus by Lady Wachter herself.  As they approach:
> This house seems disgusted with itself.  A slouching roof hangs heavy over furrowed gables, and moss-covered walls sag and bulge under the weight of the vegetation.  As you study the house's sullen countenance you hear the edifice actually groan

The players are welcomed by Lady Wachter's valet Haliq and escorted to the dining room, where they are set a feast.  Ernst Lanark hovers nearby, watching - but clearly not welcome to the feast.  The menu for the feast is:

| Course | Item | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Appetizer | Chard Salad | A salad of roasted chard leaves along with roasted parsnips, onions, and mushrooms. Sprinkled with crumbly Krezk cheese |
| Soup | Black Soup | A sweet and sour soup cooked with blood, vinegar, cherries, and honey. Little dumplings float in the soup. |
| Main | Sausage & Potatoes | Pork sausage with boiled and buttered potatoes, served with sauerkraut. |
| Desert | Svalich Pudding | A rich pudding made from cream, eggs, blackberries, cherries, and blackcurrants. |

Lady Wachter is trying to get the measure of the party.  She is planning a coup d'etat tomorrow at the festival, and she is unsure what the arrival of the party means for those plans - they could be mercenaries hired by the baron to protect him, or they could be passers-by - still dangerous if they draw swords during the conflict.  On the other hand if they could be convinced to side with her...

Things the Lady 'knows'...
* The Baron is not a good man and in his heart he does not truly care for the people of Vallaki.  He is of short temper, and frail ego - burdening the people of the town with his inane laws and freak festivals to prove he is a great and benevolent ruler, while throwing any who speaks but a word of dissent into the stockade - or worse.  
* His henchman Izek is worse - a sadist who loves torturing people.  There are enough people who disappear into the Baron's grasp - into that sadist's grasp - who never return or who return broken body and soul.  I do not know what he does, but it is terrible.
* The baron's son Viktor holds an especially dark place in the Lady's heart.  Once upon a time Viktor and her daughter Stella were betrothed.  But something that boy did to her broke her mind - forcing Lady Wachter to send her beloved Stella to the Abbey of St. Markovia.
* The festivals are pitiful, and the Baron knows - or should know - they are pointless.  Stradh is the sovereign overlord of Barovia and all within it - if he wished to meddle in the affairs of Vallaki he would do so, and no amount of festivals or good vibes would keep him out.  The fact that he does not is evidence that Stradh is more of an absentee landlord than a direct threat to the people of Vallaki.  He has his own plans, his own pursuits - women, mostly, but there is one woman in particular he seeks.  And he can be reasoned with.  The Baron is just a stubborn, hateful fool.

If the party manage to snoop around the house for a bit and subsequently confront her with some or all of her own indiscretions she will be defensive:

 - **The Body of Her Deceased Husband:** "Yes, I keep my husband's body here.  I cannot mourn him properly with the Baron's foolish laws.  And I dare not bury him in secret beyond these walls - I will not allow his corpse to become part of the corruption of this land."
 - **Stella Imprisoned:** "No, I did not send my daughter to the Abbey.  How could I?  Have you heard what happens to people there?  I have heard... rumours.  I could not take a chance with my daughter.  Not... not like that."
 - **Secret Cult:** "What of it?  You think the Baron does not use similar means of gathering his helpers?  It is just a coincidence that his son and his right hand man are the most sadistic bastards in all of Barovia?  Yes, we practice magic.  Maybe you think them dark magics.  Look around you - this is a dark land."

If they get too pushy she will eject them.  If they get REALLY too pushy she will try to have them assassinated.  But ideally she will get them on her side, because the revolution starts tomorrow!

The party might also be inclined to investigate Lady Wachter's claims after dinner.  If they want to, allow them to explore the Baron's mansion (map is available, but try theatre of the mind I guess?)

##### Festival of the Blazing Sun
###### Part I - The Parade
This can go one of two way, depending on the players interactions with Lady Wachter.  If Lady Wachter is confident of the assistance (or at least neutrality) of the party then go the way of the Laughing Guard.  Otherwise go the way of the Consort of Stradh.

*The Laughing Guard*
> Under threatening skies, a parade of unhappy children dressed as flowers and wearing forced smiles trudges through the muddy streets, leading the way for a group of sorry-looking men and women carrying a ten-foot-diameter wicker ball. The burgomaster and his smiling wife, who holds a sad bouquet of wilting flowers, follow the procession on horseback. As weary spectators watch from their stoops, the ball is borne to the town square. There, it is hoisted and hung from a fifteen-foot-high wooden scaffold, and townsfolk take turns splashing it with oil. Before the wicker sun can be set ablaze, the sky tears open in a sudden downpour. "All will be well!" cries the burgomaster as he brandishes a sputtering torch and marches defiantly through the rain toward the wicker ball, only to have his torch go out as he thrusts it into the sphere. 
>
>A singular laugh erupts from the crowd, drawing the burgomaster's fiery gaze as well as gasps from the townsfolk.

The laugh comes from Lars Kjurls, a member of the town militia.  The baron immediately orders Lars arrested for "Spite" and orders the other guards to take him into custody.  However as other guardsmen approach Lars another voice intervenes...

> "No..."
>
> A loud, familiar feminine voice comes from the crowd, slicing through the square like thunder on a storm cloud  "...men and women of the Town Watch, take not one step further toward this man!"  You see Lady Wachter step forward, the crowd parting around her powerful presence, her eyes blazing with cold fire.  
>
>"You dare raise a blade against him—for a laugh? A laugh? And yet you bow to a man who wraps this town in shackles of forced cheer, who hangs ribbons over rot, and dares call it salvation!"
>
>"You are not his dogs! You are the blood of Vallaki—born of hardship, tempered by shadow, proud and unbroken. And yet you march in lockstep for a tyrant who would burn your homes to fuel his next festival!"
>
> You see others, dressed in cloaks similar to that worn by Lady Wachter.  They cheer her words.  And their hands are on their weapons
> 
>  "How many more parades must we endure while the devil laughs from his castle and the Baron plays at being king? How many more ‘joyous proclamations’ while your neighbors disappear in the night?"
>
> "This is not justice. This is not joy. This is a gilded noose! So I say - cut it! Cast down your false Baron and let this town breathe free air again! You’ve lived in fear long enough. Today, Vallaki remembers its spine!"
>
> As the words are spoken the crowd reacts, some cheering in support of the Lady Wachter, others muttering about her impertinence.  As the Baron gestures to the guards to stop her, blades are drawn amongst the crowd too.   

*The Consort of Stradh*
> Under threatening skies, a parade of unhappy children dressed as flowers and wearing forced smiles trudges through the muddy streets, leading the way for a group of sorry-looking men and women carrying a ten-foot-diameter wicker ball. The burgomaster and his smiling wife, who holds a sad bouquet of wilting flowers, follow the procession on horseback. As weary spectators watch from their stoops, the ball is borne to the town square. There, it is hoisted and hung from a fifteen-foot-high wooden scaffold, and townsfolk take turns splashing it with oil. Baron Vargas Vallakovich then steps forward, plunging a torch into the heart of the great sphere, which bursts into flames immediately.  He then turns to the assembled crowd.
>
> "People of Vallaki! Loyal hearts of our shining town! Today, we burn the rot from our midst!"
> 
> Town guards appear from the fringe of the crowd.  Four are carrying large wicker balls.  Others lead prisoners - Lady Wachter, her two sons Nikolai and Karl, and her daughter Stella.  All are brought onto the raised dais next to the Baron.  Lady Wachter, bound and gagged, glares at the Baron - at the crowd - but behind her rage you sense something else.  Panic.  Karl and Nikolai struggle vainly against their bonds.  And the young woman - Stella - wild eyed, like a cornered animal.  Feral.
>
> The Baron gestures to the family as they are forced into the wicker balls.  "Behold the rot that festered in our midst - Lady Fiona Wachter, betrayer of kin, betrayer of joy, and consort of the Devil himself!"
>
> Gasps ripple through the crowd. The Baron paces the stage with wild energy, cloak flaring behind him.
>
> "She spurned our festivals! She mocked your smiles! She schemed in the dark and whispered rebellion while the rest of you worked and worshipped and wore your joy with pride!"
>
> He stops, jabbing a finger toward her cage.
>
> "And what did we find in her house? What secrets behind her locked doors?"
> 
> He leans forward, voice lowering to a scandalized hiss.
>
> "We found the body of her husband - Nikolaj Wachter - dead these three years, still lying in her bed, dressed and perfumed, as though nothing had passed! A corpse! A rotted man kept in mockery of life, tended by a mad daughter and guarded by servants too terrified to speak!"
>
> A murmur of horror surges through the crowd.
>  
>  "Does that sound like a woman of reason? Of virtue? Of Vallaki?"
>   
>   He flings his arm wide, addressing the people with wild, glistening eyes. 
>    
> "No. She is the Devil’s bride, and her children his creatures. And today, by the light of our Festival, we shall cleanse this evil with flame!  Let it be known: in Vallaki, joy is law. And all who defy it shall burn."
>  
> "REJOICE! For all… will… be… well!"
>
> With that final word, the Baron plunges his torch into the wicker prison of Karl Wachter and begins moving up the line - determined to ensure that the Lady Fiona Wachter will see all her family die before she herself is allowed to perish.

In the "Laughing Guard" scenario a riot is starting.  The players may choose to intervene on either side, or simply avoid getting involved at all.  In the "Consort of Stradh" the players will bear witness to a violent, brutal execution of a family who (for the most part) have done nothing wrong.  Players may choose to intervene (leading to a riot) or may choose to avoid getting involved at all.  Let is all play out - the winning side depends on the players, but if the players don't get involved then it depends on the start:

*If the players side with Lady Wachter, or if the start is the "Laughing Guard" scenario and they do not choose a side:*
* Vargas Vallakovich is killed.  Lady Wachter wants a public execution, but she won't take a chance on him escaping.  
* Lydia Vallakovich is the sister of the priest at St. Andral's.  Lady Wachter is in a bind with her, as keeping her on hand would allow her to control the church.  If she can be captured alive she will be imprisoned in the Burgomaster's Mansion - her former home - to be used as leverage.
* Lady Wachter blames Vicktor Vallakovich for her daughter Stella's condition (in truth is was Izek who tortured her to the point of breaking her mind after she caught Viktor trying to wield powerful infernal magics similar to the the ones Lady Wachter uses, but Lady Wachter does not know or care about this).  Fortunately Viktor knows a bit of magic and manages to escape, teleporting away to be not seen again.
* Lady Wachter would like to feed Izek Strazni to the crows.  After she will raise him back from the dead to be her dedicated brute (although she will not let the people of Vallaki know she is behind his reanimation).
* Riots and revolutions are never fun things.  People will die and the city will burn for more than a week afterwards.  Play this up!

*If the players side with the Baron, or if the start is the "Consort of Stradh" scenario and they do not choose a side:*
* Lady Wachter and her family are all rounded up and executed very publicly (if they are not executed already).
* Believing Lady Wachter to be the heart of a conspiracy against him (which she is) the Baron will being rounding up people and executing them at random.  One of the Alastroi siblings is amongst the dead, and someone shows up to menace Urwin Martikov, before Urwin points out that his family owns the winery and if they threaten him again the taps will be cut and then the Baron will see what a revolution looks like (also, ravens will be around during this, adding a level of supernatural authority to Urwin's threats).

In either case, I assume the players will be moving on after finally getting their cold weather gear.  They might stick around to be involved, but they do have a job to do...

### Tsolenka Pass
*Note: Although it is daylight here, all vision is capped at 60 ft due to weather conditions*

#### Approach
> The shelf of rock on which the mountain road clings to grows narrow.  To your left, the icy cliffs rise sharply towards dark, rolling clouds.  To your right the ground falls away into a sea of fog.  Ahead, through the wind and snow, you see a high wall of black stone lined with spikes and topped by statues of demonic, four armed, horned figures.  Set in the centre of this wall is a closed iron portcullis, behind which burns a curtain of green flame.
>
> Emerging from the flickering wall of green flames that dances like spectral fire across the gate, a figure steps forward with the grace of a shadow and the poise of a king. The flames part for him, curling back like servants bowing before their master, casting eerie light across his pale, statuesque face. His black cloak flutters in the chill mountain wind, edges singed with ember-glow, but untouched by the flame itself.
>
>His eyes—two smoldering coals of crimson—scan the mountain pass with ancient boredom and predatory interest. Every movement he makes is deliberate, fluid, and terrifyingly calm, as though the world itself bends politely to his stride. The golden embroidery on his dark vest catches the flame’s glow, glinting like fresh blood on polished steel. You know this figure - both from his appearance when you were pulled into this cursed land, and by his reputation here in Barovia - this is Count Stradh von Zarovich, Lord of Barovia.
>
>Behind him, the flames resume their chaotic dance—but he stands still, a figure of cold command framed in ghostly green light, the stormy sky rolling behind him. No living thing dares breathe too loud. Strahd has arrived.
>
> "You know, you will not find what you seek in this place.  I will not pretend to know much about your purpose and your reasons, but I know you seek a way to walk free from this prison.  I have come to tell you that you will not find it here."
>
> "I came here, eons ago, in search of something similar.  I heard whispers of shadowed secrets and forbidden knowledge.  The ancients, it was said, knew what I could not.  Do you know what I found?"
> 
> "Nothing.  Empty promises and the shell of something greater."
> 
> "Do yourselves a favour.  Leave this path.  Come and join me in Castle Ravenloft.  You are prisoners here, it is true, but you need not make Barovia a prison.  You are not the usual sort who wander into my domain.  You are powerful.  Formidable.  Come - join me.  Help me regain my Katarina.  That feat and that feat alone will break the endless cycle of this land, and free all of us!"

Stradh will happily converse with his players and discuss anything and everything with them.  He is genuine with his invitation, and his motives are clear - high level adventurers like the party would be useful to him.  If they attack him they will find that Stradh's form here is just an image.  And if they choose to continue to seek the Amber Temple...

> "As you wish.  I am not so foolish as to try to stop the likes of you.  Neither will I help you though.  Not any longer.  Barovia is a dangerous land, and while I have kept the dangers at bay heretofore, I will do so no longer.  Consider this a warning - if you travel beyond this gate, you do so on your own.

With that the image of Stradh will fade, and players will be faced with the gate of flames. 

#### T1. Gatehouse Portcullis
The gate here is old and is rusted open here - the way is now barred with magical green flame instead of metal.

#### T2. Demon Statues
These statues are actually guardians of the gate.  If the players attack the statues, pass through (or over, or under, or around) the gate, they will become two glabrezu and attack the players.

#### T3. Curtain of Green Flame
The archway is filled with a curtain of green flame.  Any creature that starts its turn in the green flame and any creature that enters the curtain for takes 6d10 fire damage.  A successful casting of dispel magic (DC 16) suppresses the curtain, as does any anti-magic field.

#### T4. Guard Tower, Bottom Floor
The door to this area is made of iron bound wood and has been barred from the inside.  A DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check is required to open it.  

> A cold hearth stands across from the door, the wind howling down the its chimney.  A stone staircase lines the south wall.  Three windows look out over ai ea of endless fog.

The stairs climb to T5.

#### T5.  Guard Tower, Upper Floor
> The upper level of this tower is an icebox, with windows set into almost every wall, letting the wind howl through mercilessly.  A rusted iron ladder bolted to the floor and ceiling leads up to a wooden trapdoor.  Mounted above the cold stone hearth is a dire wolf's head - the wind coming down the chimney howls in the stead of it's now stolen voice.

The ladder leads up to T6

#### T6. Guard Tower, Rooftop
>Ten foot tall, gold plated statues stand atop the battlements, facing outward.  Each one depicts a human knight, holding a lance.  The cold wind stirs the snow, under which you count five human skeletons clad in rusty chain mail.

The roof here is 40 ft above the Tsolenka Pass and 50 ft above the mist shrouded valley below.  A squeaky wooden trapdoor in the floor leads to T5 below.  The skeletons are the remains of the five guards who last held this post long ago.  If characters search the remains they will find nothing useful - just bits of tattered cloth, rotted and broken longbows and rusty weapons and mail but they will disturb the souls of the dead, summoning the feuereis (who start in ice form) - the frozen souls of the former guards of this place.

#### Nameless Area
After the players leave the guard tower but before they reach the bridge the following occurs...

> As you move along the narrow path here you begin to hear a rumbling in the mountains to your left.  It gets closer and close - you become aware that whatever is coming must be massive.  And then you see it - this massive beast rumbling through the mists, it's feet causing the earth to rumble with every step.  Brown shaggy hair, blood red eyes and crimson stained tusks bear down upon you.

#### T7. Western Arch
> The snowy pass come to a gorge spanned by a stone bridge.  At each end of the bridge is a thirty foot tall, thirty foot wide stone arch.  Atop each are two statues of armoured knights on horseback with lances, charging towards one another.  The wind bites and howls like wolves running down the gorge.

#### T8. Stone Bridge
> The low walls that enclose the stone bridge have fallen away in a couple places, but the bridge itself appears intact.

If Sangzor does a lot of damage to the party then skip this encounter.  Otherwise....

> As you get about halfway across the bridge you hear a guttural, angry shriek out into the mists, and the soft, leathery beating of wings upon the winds....

A young red shadow dragon begins to attack the party on the bridge.  He will do flybys, using the mists and his speed (and his ability to hide in shadows) to appear from the mists, swoop down, grapple a character, and then soar once more into the air - trying to pick them off one by one.

#### T9. Eastern Arch
> One of the statues atop this arch has crumbled, leaving only the horse's hindquarters intact.  


## Food and Drink in Barovia
### Foods in Barovia
#### Morgantha's Dream Pies
Eating one of Morgantha's pies has one of the following effects:
* If eaten as a bonus action in combat you may add 1d4 to any attack roll or saving throw in the next minute.
* If eaten outside of combat it heals 2d4+2 hp
* If eaten before a long rest, you gain two extra hit dice to use during the next day.

However they are addictive.  The morning after you eat one roll a DC 10+2*(Total Number of Pies Eaten Lifetime) Constitution Save.  If they fail they become first level addicts.  Addicts have debuffs added to their character that make them weaker.  They can remedy this by eating a pie (from which they gain no other benefits - however eating subsequent pies does give them one of the benefits) or they can suffer through the addiction.  If they consume even a single pie during the day they run the risk of getting further addicted (make a new save the following morning).  If they go 24 hours without eating a pie the next morning they can make a save to drop down one level on the addiction chart.  *LPC stands for lifetime pie consumption - how many pies they have eaten total.  Track this!*

| Level | Impact | Con Save Better | Con Save Worse |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| First | +1 Exhaustion |  10+2x(LPC) | 12+2x(LPC) | 
| Second | +2 Exhaustion | 12+2x(LPC) | 14+2x(LPC) |
| Third | +3 Exhaustion | 14+2x(LPC) | -- |

### Drink in Barovia
Almost all alcohol in Barovia is wine or wine-based, and almost all wine is made by the Martikov family (some is brought in by Vistani traders).  A description of the Martikov family wines is below:

#### Grapesmash
Grapesmash is the lowest grade of Martikov wine.  It is a red wine, made from grapes unfit for any other purpose.  It is, however, widely available.  Grapesmash wines tend to be tannin heavy and have a bitter, metallic aftertaste.  The Martikov's sell three types of Grapesmash wines - Grapesmash #3, which is purely made from Grapesmash grapes (and thus has the most pronounced Grapesmash 'flavour') and Grapesmash #2 & #1 - each of which uses progressively more of the Martikov's other grapes to dull the harsh edge of Grapesmash.
 
#### Dragoncrush
Dragoncrush is a red varietal from the Martikov winery.  They make two varieties of this varietal - Red Dragoncrush and Black Dragoncrush - as well as a brandy which is made from Red Dragoncrush called Dragon's Breath.  Red Dragoncrush uses dried grapes and is aged in oak barrels, giving it a spicy, cinnamony flavour.  Black Dragoncrush mixes fresh Dragoncrush grapes with Winterstomp grapes to give it a fresh, crisp flavour.  Dragon's Breath Brandy leans into the natural flavours of Red Dragoncrush, and is very spicy.  

#### Winterstomp
Winterstomp is a white varietal from the Martikov winery.  They are mainly used to balance the flavours of the Martikov Red varietals, as the grapes themselves are almost too acidic on their own.  The Martikov's do make a sparkling Winterstomp wine that is somewhat refreshing (if very acidic).
