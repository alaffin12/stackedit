# Arrival in Urik
> You stumble, boots striking sun-baked stone, the air immediately thick with dust and heat. Gone is the shimmer of planar energy — now, a narrow alley stretches before you, hemmed in by mud-brick walls scorched black by relentless sun. The sky above is not blue, but a pale brass haze, the sun twice as large and three times as cruel.  The very air scrapes at your lungs - dry, bitter, and heavy with ash. A faint stench of sweat, smoke, and something like roasted blood wafts in from nearby streets.  Beneath your feet, even the shadows seem thirsty.
> 
> Somewhere beyond these narrow walls, a city groans in the heat: you hear the bark of a trader, the creak of leather, the low chant of a distant crowd. But here, in this alley - you are alone for now.  Alone in Athas.  And it does not want you here.

Allow the players a moment to collect themselves, then let them step out into one of the bustling streets of the Old District of Urik...

> You press out from the alley into the streets of the city proper — and are immediately struck by the weight of gaze. The people here — wiry, sun-darkened, wrapped in layered cloth and bone jewelry — do not stare long, but they notice you. Foreigners are rare in Urik.  The street is a narrow vein of dust and sun, flanked by crumbling buildings of ochre clay and obsidian inlay. Above, banners of cracked leather snap in the wind. Below, slaves pull wheeled carts, and children chase lizards through the dust.   Above it a short tower rises from the rest of the city like a broken tooth, humming faintly with energy.
>
> Then — a voice behind you: *"Zata ve'khal... ashal tomar?"* ("Who are you, where are you from?" in Urik)
>
> A man steps forward, short and wiry, wrapped in sun-bleached linens and a layered mantle of carved bone discs. His skin is the color of scorched iron, his head shaved save for a small braid at the crown. A curved dagger hangs from his belt, but his hands are raised - open, cautious.  He peers at you, confused, then frowns. After a pause, he clears his throat, and speaks again — this time in a guttural, broken version of Common: *“You not from here. Outsiders, yes?  Outsiders strange here.  Most in Foreign Quarter”*
>
> He steps closer, cautiously respectful now, and taps his chest with two fingers.
>
> *“I Pakkun. I speak for trade.  For you for trade. I... show, explain. Yes? You pay, I talk. You no speak Urik-tongue, you get... killed. Or sold.”*
>
> He gestures to the crowded marketplace beyond, where guards in spiked bronze armor patrol with carved obsidian rods. Several already watch you with mild curiosity — or suspicion.  *“Yes? You want Pakkun… alive, not dead?”*
> 
> His smile is dry and sharp as cracked leather. His eyes never stop moving.

### Travelling with Pakkun
Pakkun is a native of Urik who has decided to make a few coin showing these outsiders around.  He is generally friendly and will try and help the party, although if he sees them break the law he will also report them.  Pakkun has a few scripted reactions based on some of the quirks of Athas:

#### Scripted Reactions
##### Iron/Steel
Since Iron and Steel are so rare in Athas, seeing anyone in the party wearing those metals will result in a strong reaction: 
> Pakkun freezes, his eyes wide.  And worried.  *"Is... is metal?"* He says the word metal like it burns on his tongue.  *"Real?  No fake shell?  No bone paint?  You bring to Urik?"*  He glances left and right as his voice drops - low and urgent.  *"Hide.  Walk with iron, get killed.  Get worse.  Wear skin of lion in goat herd.  Fool?  King?  People not know which.  You cover it.  Bone wrap.  Cloth.  I find yes?  You pay, I find, keep walking.  You no pay, I say nothing.  I walk alone.  No want trouble.  Others will see.  Will say."*  
> 
> He pauses, stepping forward and talking in almost a whisper now.  *"Metal not tool.  Metal power.  It belong to Lion King.  You show that - templars come.  Thieves come, nobles come, slavers come.  All come."* He shakes his head *"You not from here, clear.   Metal?  Provocation.  Dangerous."*

##### Gold
If the players try to use a gold coin (a silver might also elicit a similar reaction - improvise if needed):
> Pakkun's eyes lock onto the gold piece for a long moment and he stands there, almost not breathing.  Then he says in a whisper: *"Is... is gold."*  He steps back a half a pace, his eyes quickly darting to alleys and rooftops.  Looking for something.  His voice hisses now.  *"You show this?  Here?  Just... in hand?  That... that worth more than many years work.  You buy slave caravan with.  Worth more than man's life.  Twenty times!"*
>
> Pakkun looks at you, his gaze sharp and calculating.  His mouth is dry.  He licks his lips.  *"You mad?  Stupid?  Give to wrong man, show to wrong man, you no walk away.  Templars see... Templars think they see  they carve out teeth to find more."*  He glances around again, then reaches out and closes your hand around it, hiding it.  *"Pakkun not want death.  You want pay Pakkun, pay in bits.  In ceramic.  I take you place where you trade, yes?  Not gold.  Have gold - have silver?  Have copper?  Trade eight ceramic for copper.  Eighty for silver.  Not trade much at one time.  One silver maybe.  Or few copper.  Not more. Too many see.  Trader take some for themselves, but good deal.  Best in district.  Then you pay Pakkun, not get him killed."*

#### Psionics
If a player reveals they have psionic powers:
> Pakkun sees you, your power, and you can watch him flinch in reaction.  *"Skies!  You... you walk the Way?"* His eyes quickly dart around, to see who might have seen.  *"No badge on you.  No glaze.  Hair not cut.  You mad?  All who walk the Way must go to Templars.  They give mark - badge.  Glazed.  You break it.  They break you.  They see you now they come to take you.  Kill you.  The Way strong, but Templars stronger."*  He looks at you and considers.  *"But maybe you not walk the Way.  Maybe you not need glaze.  Pakkun not know.  Pakkun still guide.  But tell Pakkun before you decide to fly mind okay?  Give Pakkun time to hide."*

#### Arcane Magic
If a player reveals they command arcane magic:
> Pakkun's face goes pale.  *"No.  No!  No no no!  You... you cast?  Here?  HERE?  Skies burn me.  You mad jackals!"*  He begins to back away from the party, terrified - so terrified that he stumbles but he still does not take his eyes from you *"Mad!  They see me with you!  They kill you.  They kill me.  Makes no spit.  All the same to the king."*  He turns to run.  *"I never seen you.  I not know your names.  We never meet.  You die alone!"*

Pakkun will flee in terror, and the Templars will arrive shortly after that

#### Divine Magic
If a player reveals they command divine magic:
> *"Old power.  Deep power."* Pakkun say, nodding *"Call river, stone, flame or wind?  

The first place Pakkun will take the party is the Bright Water Well:

> *"Bright Water Well here.  First.  Most important.  Many feet.  Many smells.  Crowd always - beggar, beast, trader, templar-wife.  All want water.  All but templar pay"*
>
> *"Water not free here.  Want cup.  Five bit.  Small coin.  Want jug - day worth?  Two pieces.  Big coin.  Want more?  Don't know.  Might not get more.  Water Merchant might stop you.  Need to share."*
> 
> He gestures to a large stele in the middle of the square, near the well.  *"See big stone?  That code.  Law.  Hamanu's Code.  Say who drink.  Who wait.  Who die if steal.  I no read glyphs - only templars and nobles learn.  But stone say how to live like good man.  How to die like thirsty rat."*
> 
> *"You see coins, you leave yes?  No touch.  Folk leave coin.  Make wish.  Maybe water taste sweeter.  Maybe son not taken for army.  But take coin?  Take curse.  Bad luck.  Worse.  Templars say take coin is crime.  Against Hamanu's Code.
