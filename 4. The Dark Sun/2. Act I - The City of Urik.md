> You stumble, boots striking sun-baked stone, the air immediately thick with dust and heat. Gone is the shimmer of planar energy — now, a narrow alley stretches before you, hemmed in by mud-brick walls scorched black by relentless sun. The sky above is not blue, but a pale brass haze, the sun twice as large and three times as cruel.  The very air scrapes at your lungs - dry, bitter, and heavy with ash. A faint stench of sweat, smoke, and something like roasted blood wafts in from nearby streets.  Beneath your feet, even the shadows seem thirsty.
> 
> Somewhere beyond these narrow walls, a city groans in the heat: you hear the bark of a trader, the creak of leather, the low chant of a distant crowd. But here, in this alley - you are alone for now.  Alone in Athas.  And it does not want you here.

Allow the players a moment to collect themselves, then let them step out into one of the bustling streets of the Old District of Urik...

> You press out from the alley into the streets of the city proper — and are immediately struck by the weight of gaze. The people here — wiry, sun-darkened, wrapped in layered cloth and bone jewelry — do not stare long, but they notice you. Foreigners are rare in Urik.  The street is a narrow vein of dust and sun, flanked by crumbling buildings of ochre clay and obsidian inlay. Above, banners of cracked leather snap in the wind. Below, slaves pull wheeled carts, and children chase lizards through the dust. At the end of the street, a ziggurat rises like a broken tooth, humming faintly with psionic energy.

Then — a voice behind you.

> "Zata ve'khal... ashal tomar?"

A man steps forward, short and wiry, wrapped in sun-bleached linens and a layered mantle of carved bone discs. His skin is the color of scorched iron, his head shaved save for a small braid at the crown. A curved dagger hangs from his belt, but his hands are raised — open, cautious.

He peers at you, confused, then frowns. After a pause, he clears his throat, and speaks again — this time in a guttural, broken version of Common:

> “You… are not from here. _Very_ not from here. Outsiders, yes? You fell from sky? No—_from nothing_.”

He steps closer, cautiously respectful now, and taps his chest with two fingers.

> “I am **Pakkun**. I speak for trade. I… show, explain. Yes? You pay, I talk. You no speak Urik-tongue, you get... killed. Or sold.”

He gestures to the crowded marketplace beyond, where guards in spiked bronze armor patrol with carved obsidian rods. Several already watch you with mild curiosity — or suspicion.

> “Yes? You want Pakkun… _alive_, not dead?”

His smile is dry and sharp as cracked leather. His eyes never stop moving.
