> You stumble, boots striking sun-baked stone, the air immediately thick with dust and heat. Gone is the shimmer of planar energy — now, a narrow alley stretches before you, hemmed in by mud-brick walls scorched black by relentless sun. The sky above is not blue, but a pale brass haze, the sun twice as large and three times as cruel.  The very air scrapes at your lungs - dry, bitter, and heavy with ash. A faint stench of sweat, smoke, and something like roasted blood wafts in from nearby streets.  Beneath your feet, even the shadows seem thirsty.
> 
> Somewhere beyond these narrow walls, a city groans in the heat: you hear the bark of a trader, the creak of leather, the low chant of a distant crowd. But here, in this alley - you are alone for now.  Alone in Athas.  And it does not want you here.

Allow the players a moment to collect themselves, then let them step out into one of the bustling streets of the Old District of Urik...

> You press out from the alley into the streets of the city proper — and are immediately struck by the weight of gaze. The people here — wiry, sun-darkened, wrapped in layered cloth and bone jewelry — do not stare long, but they notice you. Foreigners are rare in Urik.  The street is a narrow vein of dust and sun, flanked by crumbling buildings of ochre clay and obsidian inlay. Above, banners of cracked leather snap in the wind. Below, slaves pull wheeled carts, and children chase lizards through the dust.   Above it a short tower rises from the rest of the city like a broken tooth, humming faintly with energy.
>
> Then — a voice behind you: *"Zata ve'khal... ashal tomar?"* ("Who are you, where are you from?" in Urik)
>
> A man steps forward, short and wiry, wrapped in sun-bleached linens and a layered mantle of carved bone discs. His skin is the color of scorched iron, his head shaved save for a small braid at the crown. A curved dagger hangs from his belt, but his hands are raised - open, cautious.  He peers at you, confused, then frowns. After a pause, he clears his throat, and speaks again — this time in a guttural, broken version of Common: *“You not from here. Outsiders, yes?  Strange see outsiders here.  Usually turn away at gates.”*
>
> He steps closer, cautiously respectful now, and taps his chest with two fingers.
>
> *“I Pakkun. I speak for trade.  For you for trade. I... show, explain. Yes? You pay, I talk. You no speak Urik-tongue, you get... killed. Or sold.”*
>
> He gestures to the crowded marketplace beyond, where guards in spiked bronze armor patrol with carved obsidian rods. Several already watch you with mild curiosity — or suspicion.  *“Yes? You want Pakkun… alive, not dead?”*
> 
> His smile is dry and sharp as cracked leather. His eyes never stop moving.

If Pakkun sees any metal on the party:

> Pakkun freezes, his eyes wide.  And worried.  *"Is... is metal?"* He says the word metal like it burns on his tongue.  *"Real?  No fake shell?  No bone paint?  You bring to Urik?"*  He glances left and right as his voice drops - low and urgent.  *"Hide.  Walk with iron, get killed.  Get worse.  Wear skin of lion in goat herd.  Fool?  King?  People not know which.  You cover it.  Bone wrap.  Cloth.  I find yes?  You pay, I find, keep walking.  You no pay, I say nothing.  I walk alone.  No want trouble.  Others will see.  Will say."*  
> 
> He pauses, stepping forward and talking in almost a whisper now.  *"Metal not tool.  Metal power.  It belong to Lion King.  You show that - templars come.  Thieves come, nobles come, slavers come.  All come."* He shakes his head *"You not from here, clear.  But that?  Metal?  Provocation.  Dangerous."*

If the party offers Pakkun gold for his assistance:

> Pakkun's eyes lock onto the gold piece for a long moment and he stands there, almost not breathing.  Then he says in a whisper: *"Is... is gold."*  He steps back a half a pace, his eyes quickly darting to alleys and rooftops.  Looking for something.  His voice hisses now.  *"You show this?  Here?  Just... in hand?  That... that worth more than many years work.  You buy slave caravan with.  Worth more than man's life.  Twenty times!"*
>
> Pakkun looks at you, his gaze sharp and calculating.  His mouth is dry.  He licks his lips.  *"You mad?  Stupid?  Give to wrong man, you know walk away.  Templars see... think they see  they carve out teeth to find more."*  He glances around again, then reaches out and closes your hand around it, hiding it.  *"Pakkun not want to die.  You want pay Pakkun, pay in bits.  In ceramic.  I take you place where you trade, yes?  Not gold.  Have gold - have silver?  Have copper?  Trade eight ceramic for copper.  Eighty for silver.  Take some for themselves, but good deal.  Best in district.  Then you pay Pakkun, not get him killed."*
