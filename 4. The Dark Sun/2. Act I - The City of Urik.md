# Arrival in Urik
> You stumble, boots striking sun-baked stone, the air immediately thick with dust and heat. Gone is the shimmer of planar energy — now, a narrow alley stretches before you, hemmed in by mud-brick walls scorched black by relentless sun. The sky above is not blue, but a pale brass haze, the sun twice as large and three times as cruel.  The very air scrapes at your lungs - dry, bitter, and heavy with ash. A faint stench of sweat, smoke, and something like roasted blood wafts in from nearby streets.  Beneath your feet, even the shadows seem thirsty.
> 
> Somewhere beyond these narrow walls, a city groans in the heat: you hear the bark of a trader, the creak of leather, the low chant of a distant crowd. But here, in this alley - you are alone for now.  Alone in Athas.  And it does not want you here.

Allow the players a moment to collect themselves, then let them step out into one of the bustling streets of the Old District of Urik...

> You press out from the alley into the streets of the city proper — and are immediately struck by the weight of gaze. The people here — wiry, sun-darkened, wrapped in layered cloth and bone jewelry — do not stare long, but they notice you. Foreigners are rare in Urik.  The street is a narrow vein of dust and sun, flanked by crumbling buildings of ochre clay and obsidian inlay. Above, banners of cracked leather snap in the wind. Below, slaves pull wheeled carts, and children chase lizards through the dust.   Above it a short tower rises from the rest of the city like a broken tooth, humming faintly with energy.
>
> Then — a voice behind you: *"Zata ve'khal... ashal tomar?"* ("Who are you, where are you from?" in Urik)
>
> A man steps forward, short and wiry, wrapped in sun-bleached linens and a layered mantle of carved bone discs. His skin is the color of scorched iron, his head shaved save for a small braid at the crown. A curved dagger hangs from his belt, but his hands are raised - open, cautious.  He peers at you, confused, then frowns. After a pause, he clears his throat, and speaks again — this time in a guttural, broken version of Common: *“You not from here. Outsiders, yes?  Outsiders strange here.  Most in Foreign Quarter”*
>
> He steps closer, cautiously respectful now, and taps his chest with two fingers.
>
> *“I Pakkun. I speak for trade.  For you for trade. I... show, explain. Yes? You pay, I talk. You no speak Urik-tongue, you get... killed. Or sold.”*
>
> He gestures to the crowded marketplace beyond, where guards in spiked bronze armor patrol with carved obsidian rods. Several already watch you with mild curiosity — or suspicion.  *“Yes? You want Pakkun… alive, not dead?”*
> 
> His smile is dry and sharp as cracked leather. His eyes never stop moving.

## Scene 1: Travelling with Pakkun
Pakkun is a native of Urik who has decided to make a few coin showing these outsiders around.  He is generally friendly and will try and help the party, although if he sees them break the law he will also report them.  Pakkun has a few scripted reactions based on some of the quirks of Athas:

### Scripted Reactions
#### Iron/Steel
Since Iron and Steel are so rare in Athas, seeing anyone in the party wearing those metals will result in a strong reaction: 
> Pakkun freezes, his eyes wide.  And worried.  *"Is... is metal?"* He says the word metal like it burns on his tongue.  *"Real?  No fake shell?  No bone paint?  You bring to Urik?"*  He glances left and right as his voice drops - low and urgent.  *"Hide.  Walk with iron, get killed.  Get worse.  Wear skin of lion in goat herd.  Fool?  King?  People not know which.  You cover it.  Bone wrap.  Cloth.  I find yes?  You pay, I find, keep walking.  You no pay, I say nothing.  I walk alone.  No want trouble.  Others will see.  Will say."*  
> 
> He pauses, stepping forward and talking in almost a whisper now.  *"Metal not tool.  Metal power.  It belong to Lion King.  You show that - templars come.  Thieves come, nobles come, slavers come.  All come."* He shakes his head *"You not from here, clear.   Metal?  Provocation.  Dangerous."*

#### Gold
If the players try to use a gold coin (a silver might also elicitr reaction - improvise if needed):stan asi
> Pakkun's eyes lock onto the gold piece for a long moment and he stands there, almost not breathing.  Then he says in a whisper: *"Is... is gold."*  He steps back a half a pace, his eyes quickly darting to alleys and rooftops.  Looking for something.  His voice hisses now.  *"You show this?  Here?  Just... in hand?  That... that worth more than many years work.  You buy slave caravan with.  Worth more than man's life.  Twenty times!"*
>
> Pakkun looks at you, his gaze sharp and calculating.  His mouth is dry.  He licks his lips.  *"You mad?  Stupid?  Give to wrong man, show to wrong man, you no walk away.  Templars see... Templars think they see  they carve out teeth to find more."*  He glances around again, then reaches out and closes your hand around it, hiding it.  *"Pakkun not want death.  You want pay Pakkun, pay in bits.  In ceramic.  I take you place where you trade, yes?  Not gold.  Have gold - have silver?  Have copper?  Trade eight ceramic for copper.  Eighty for silver.  Not trade much at one time.  One silver maybe.  Or few copper.  Not more. Too many see.  Trader take some for themselves, but good deal.  Best in district.  Then you pay Pakkun, not get him killed."*

#### Psionics
If a player reveals they have psionic powers:
> Pakkun sees you, your power, and you can watch him flinch in reaction.  *"Skies!  You... you walk the Way?"* His eyes quickly dart around, to see who might have seen.  *"No badge on you.  No glaze.  Hair not cut.  You mad?  All who walk the Way must go to Templars.  They give mark - badge.  Glazed.  You break it.  They break you.  They see you now they come to take you.  Kill you.  The Way strong, but Templars stronger."*  He looks at you and considers.  *"But maybe you not walk the Way.  Maybe you not need glaze.  Pakkun not know.  Pakkun still guide.  But tell Pakkun before you decide to fly mind okay?  Give Pakkun time to hide."*

#### Arcane Magic
If a player reveals they command arcane magic:
> Pakkun's face goes pale.  *"No.  No!  No no no!  You... you cast?  Here?  HERE?  Skies burn me.  You mad jackals!"*  He begins to back away from the party, terrified - so terrified that he stumbles but he still does not take his eyes from you *"Mad!  They see me with you!  They kill you.  They kill me.  Makes no spit.  All the same to the king."*  He turns to run.  *"I not see you.  I not know your names.  We never meet.  You die alone!"*

Pakkun will flee in terror, and the Templars will arrive shortly after that

#### Divine Magic
If a player reveals they command divine magic:
> *"Old power.  Deep power."* Pakkun say, nodding *"Call river, stone, flame or wind?  Here people call you speaker-for-spirits.  Or fool-for-flame sometimes.  Templars see, templars watch.  But not burn - unless stir the wrong wind.  You call water?  You fix blood?  Worth more than ceramic here.  But Pakkun say this - do not wave power near Templar shadow.  Templar jealous.  Think only they should speak to sky."*

### The Old District
Pakkun will guide the players through the old district - the first and most important destination will be the Bright Water Well - the main water source for the district.  As they get close Pakkun will explain things to the party.

> *"Bright Water Well.  First.  Most important.  Many feet.  Many smells.  Crowd always - beggar, beast, trader - even templar and templar-wife.  All want water.  All but templar payWater not free here.  Want cup  Five bit.  Small coin.  Want jug - day worth?  Two pieces.  Big coin.  Want more?  Don't know.  Might not get more.  Might stop you.  Need to share."*
> 
> He gestures to a large stele in the middle of the square, near the well.  *"See big stone?  That law.  Hamanu's Code.  Say who drink.  Who wait.  Who die if steal.  PakkunI not read - only templars and nobles learn.  But stone say how to live like good man.  How to die like thirsty rat."*
> 
> *"You see coins, you leave yes?  No touch.  Folk leave coin.  Make wish.  Maybe water taste sweeter.  Maybe son not taken for army.  But take coin?  Take curse.  Bad luck.  Worse.  Templars see, say take coin is crime.  Against Hamanu's Code."*

Pakkun will then, for a little while, guide the party around the old district.  The area around Bright Water Well is a food market of sorts, and players can get spiced meats, spiced breads and coffee here readily.  If players are looking for something specific use the following document to figure out where to take them and improvise

### Templar Arrest
After travelling around Urik for a little while Pakkun will lead them down and alley, only to come face to face with a line of Templars on the other end, come to arrest the party and bring them before Hamanu:

> The alley ahead winds between low, sunbaked brick walls — the kind of place where the city's poorest cook bitter roots in clay pots and sleep beneath salvaged awnings. Pakkun strides ahead confidently, half-glancing over his shoulder.  *“Almost there, yes? Pakkun know the Old District like he know hand. Not far now…”*
> >
> Suddenly he turns a corner and freezes, the color draining from his face.  The sound of boots - lots of boots - stomping through the dusty street in perfect time fills the alley and from around the corner emerges a line of soldiers, yellow lacquered armor and black-tipped spears that gleam in the sunlight.  Behind them a taller figure, his armor of broze and bearing the sigil of the lion - the sigil of Urik.  
> >
> *"Templars..."* Pakkun exclaims, stumbling backwards *"...a high Templar?  Skies burn me."*  He begins babbling in his native tongue (those who can understand the native tongue of Urik recognize that he is claiming innocence and begging forgiveness).  As he does another line of Templar's emerge from behind you, sealing the other exit to the alley, and several other Templar's appear on the rooftop, their weapons trained on you.  *"Tell them..."* Pakkun shouts back at you, tears cutting lines on his dusty, sun-baked face *"...whatever you do.  Tell them Pakkun not a part of it!  Please!  Pakkun just guide.  Just talk.  Please.  Swear it."*
> >
> One of the Templars shoves Pakkun to the ground.  Another drives his spear into him - killing him, or wounding him badly enough that he will soon be dead.  You hear another voice call out from atop the roofs - its angry, but you can't understand what is being said (unless they can in which case the voice says "Mind yourselves.  The Lion wants them alive").  You hear a voice inside your head and for the first time since your arrival you feel as if you understand fully what is being said: *"Savages.  I apologize, but they are on edge.  We have been told a great deal about you, and they fear you.  Now... sleep."*

With that all players without a background that would make them familiar with psionics will immediately lose consciousness (it is not actually a sleep spell, but the psion is disconnecting their brains, so Elves do not avoid this outcome).  If there are any left standing the voice in their head will express a touch of surprise and admiration:

>*"Ah.  You are familiar with the Way, although the Lion says you might not call it that where you are from.  I would suggest you throw down your weapons and drop to the ground nonetheless.  Your allies are not so disciplined, and I will quickly kill them if you decide to fight  You will be badly outnumbered.  The Lion ordered them to bring you in alive, but he bade me to keep his Templars alive, you understand?"*  

## Scene 2. Meeting a God
> You awaken to heat and silence.
> >
> Your wrists are shackled in obsidian-bound iron, etched with runes you do not recognize. Every movement grates against skin rubbed raw. Your clothes have been stripped and replaced with a rough white cassock, scratchy against the skin and stinking faintly of limestone and dust - a prisoner's robe, devoid of symbol or identity.
> 
> > Any among you marked as a wielder of arcane magic has been gagged, your cassock marked with chalk sigils — warning signs, as though to say “poison within”.  Any among you touched by the invisible Way - possessing powers of the mind - wears a collar of white ceramic, embedded with dull green crystal. A seal, not of punishment, but of control.
> 
> The air is heavy, dry, scented with burnt resin and ancient ash. Light lances down from a circular vent high above, a perfect disc of sun that falls only on the center of the room, illuminating a wide brass inlay — a platform ringed by six black basalt pillars, each carved with sigils of law, authority, and flame.
>
> Beneath your bare feet, the floor is smooth volcanic glass, perfectly polished. It reflects torchlight, the red gleam of coals, and the distorted image of your chained form. Heat rises in gentle waves from the stone itself, as though the palace breathes fire.
> >
> The room is vast and silent, its edges crowded with figures in yellow tabards, standing motionless like statues, their faces hidden behind snarling lion-masked helms. They hold no weapons openly, but each of them hums with the restrained energy of training and belief.
> >
> To one side stands a figure in ash-colored armor, still marked with the common yellows seen elsewhere, silent, calm, eyes closed. His shaved head is marked with intricate tattoos. His stillness is absolute, but your mind aches in his presence — like thoughts being sifted, weighed, peeled apart.
>
>And presiding above all this is a figure seated upon a high throne of molten gold and carved basalt.  His gaze is fixed upon you — not curious, not angry. Merely absolute. His arms rest on the sides of the throne, carved with the fanged visage of lions. The wall behind him depicts a vast relief of conquest, a lion-headed sovereign holding the sun in one hand and fire in the other, *casting judgment upon a kneeling world.
>
> He does not speak. He does not need to. His presence presses on the chamber like a storm front. Every question asked, every answer given, is performed beneath his eye.   Unmoving.  Unblinking.  Judging.
>
> One of the silent figures at the back of the room breaks ranks and crosses to the raised platform in the centre of the room.  When he speaks his voice carries throughout the chamber not by force by by command.  *"You stand in the presence of the great Lion of the Desert."* he says, his ability to speak in the common tongue surprising, given what you have seen *"Your tongues must speak nothing by the truth and you may speak only to respond to our questions.  A lie is a sin against this place, against our king, punishable by death.  Do you understand this?"*  

The Watcher will the question the party, under the psionic watch of Sereth Mindspike and the authority of the Lion King himself.  If the players refuse to acknowledge the figure in ash coloured armor (Sereth Mindspike) will look at the party for a moment before telling the Watcher that they understand.

The Watchers are predominantly focused on the laws of the city, and how someone bypassed their watch.  They do not perceive, nor have they been told, the greater nature of the party - how they have come from beyond Athas, and that they are combating a multiversal threat.  As such their questions will seem petty and short-sighted.  Some questions the Watcher may ask:
* *"Your feet have touched Urik's sacred soil, but you are not from the city.  No record of your entry exists.  Which gate did you pass and which Templar took your coin?"*
* *"Which house, cult, or cabal calls you its agents?  Do you speak for Raam? For the shadow-schemers of Draj? Or do you bear the sign of the Wasteborn?*
* *"What task draws you to the Lion’s city - trade, theft, or treason?  What treasure, relic, or secret was worth risking the wrath of Hamanu?”*
* (if there is a divine spellcaster) *"You call upon a power not your own.  You carry symbols that we do not recognize.  You do not serve the Lion King.  Do you call yourself a follower of flame?  A servant of stone?  An acolyte of the air?  A worshipper of water?"*
* (if there is an arcane spellcaster) *"Your arcane spell-caster - does he not know that the art of magic is the domain of the Lion King and his servants alone?  Is he a defiler, or a preserver?"* (Sereth will speak into the minds of the party: *"Answer 'preserver' if you value your lives."*)

If the party is deceptive during any of the questions have Sereth speak into their minds collectively: *"It is unwise for you to lie.  The Templars might not recognize your deception, but I do.  As does the Lion King.  Answer truthfully.  Even if you think we will think you mad.  The truth will set you free."*  

After the party has answered the questions the soldier in ash-coloured armor will speak to the soldier asking questions: *"Thank you for your assistance brother.  These prisoners have answered truthfully, although their minds are filled with fanciful visions that cannot be real.  I believe their minds have been compromised somehow, to hide their true purpose from those who walk the Way.  But I will break them.  You and your comrades may resume your duties."*  The soldier will snap to attention, placing his hand over his heart in a fist and then leave the room, followed by the other armored figures.  After they are gone the soldier in ash coloured armor will turn to the players: *"You weave an interesting tale outsiders.  It is hardly believable.  But we will begin again.  My name is Sereth, and I am called the Mindspike by some.  I am well-versed in the Way, and I serve my king faithfully and dutifully in all that I do.  Understand that I must know the truth now.  You may choose to give it to me freely, or I will take it.  I leave the choice to you."*

Unlike the Watchers, Sereth has some idea of what the party represents - they are powerful agents who have come from some far off place.  Unlike the Watchers, who see them as more of a mundane threat - a hole in their security - Sereth sees them as an existential threat - they could bring ruin to Urik.  As such Sereth's questions will focus on the defense of Urik.  Here are some questions Sereth may ask:
* *"There are no habitable lands beyond the ringing mountains and the halfling jungles.  Yet here you are - from beyond them, beyond the edges of what is known.  What land spat you forth?  What can you tell me of it?"*
* *"You used some implement to bypass our defenses.  The Eyes did not see you until you were in the Old District.  What tool did you use?  How does it work?  How do we defend against it?"*
* *"Some of you bear the hallmarks of arcane magic - and not just a passing familiarity with it but possessing a considerable amount of skill.  Yet you bear neither the stench of a defiler nor the aura of a preserver.  How?"*
*  *"Are you kings where you come from?  Generals?  High Priests?  Or are you merely blades in a greater hand?"*
*  *"You have equipment and resources that speaks of immense wealth and power.  Are you wealthy in your homeland?  Or do you live in a land of excess, free of want?"*
*  *"If you are set free, do you remain here, beneath our sun?  Or do you vanish back to the void beyond?"*
* *"There is something behind you. A shadow, immense and still moving. It is not a king. It is not a dragon. But it would..."* Sereth pauses for a moment as a startling realization reaches him *"...it would even break... Borys?  What is it?  Is it..."* Another pause, and Sereth's confidence and composure is suddenly absent *"...is it coming here?"*
* *"Should I just kill you now, to spare us what follows?"*

After Sereth's questions have reached a point Hamanu will interject:
> From the high dais, the throne groans - not from motion, but as if the weight upon it has become suddenly heavier, more real.  A voice like breaking obsidian cuts the silence: *“You have done well, Sereth. But the truth these strangers carry is like fire wrapped in silk.  Touch it too long… and even loyal hands will burn.  You are useful to me.  I would not see you burn needlessly here.”*
> 
> Sereth hesitates, but only for a breath. He bows low and turns - without another word, leaving you along with his king.
>
> Silence follows again. But now the air feels thicker, older - as though time itself is watching.
> 
> The being upon the golden throne rises.  At first, he is cloaked in a mantle of regal cloth and carved gold. But as he steps forward, that illusion peels away like sun-bleached bark.  Behind the embroidered veil of a man is a towering figure of myth -
a leonine head crowned in obsidian curls; golden eyes glowing like twin furnaces; his staff strikes the stone once — and the orb at its head blooms with orange fire, casting shadows that twist across the marble like dancing serpents.
>
> Those shadows stretch long behind him and in their shape you see something vast. Wings. Claws. Horns. A dragon - but not born of nature.  Made. Shaped. Twisted by power.
> 
> And yet, as he descends toward you, the monstrous form begins to draw inward.  His lion's snarl recedes. His limbs compact. The fur becomes flesh. By the time he reaches the foot of the dais, he is a man once more — if only in silhouette.  Eight feet tall. Black-haired. One eye gleaming gold, the other black as a cave mouth.  He steps onto the central platform and speaks:
> 
> *“I am Hamanu.  King of Urik.  4th Champion of Rajaat.  The Lion of the Desert.  The Slayer of Myron.  Binder of Rajaat.  Called the Troll-Scorcher by some in days long past.  Immortal Tyrant.  Defender of this cursed world.”*  He looks down upon you - not in contempt, but with the sorrowful gravity of a god who has had to bury too many things.  *“You have brought with you knowledge older than the sand, and heavier than stone.  And I would know why.”*

Despite his menace and his stature, Hamanu is more relatable to the party than the Sereth or the Watchers.  He does not need answers - their answers are as clear as day to him and he understands their origins and the threat they face better than any.  But he too has questions - philosophical ones, to determine their worthiness:

* *"You seek truth. But truth is never a single blade - it wounds all who touch it.  What will you do when you find the answer you came for?  When it shames the gods, or blames the innocent? When it cannot be undone?*
* *"This is what remains of our world after truth was used.  Not lies. Not folly. Truth - stripped of mercy, wielded like a weapon.  Will your truths unmake more than they preserve?"*
* *"You search for what broke Athas.  Ask a learned man and they will name names.  Rajaat.  The Warbringers - or Champions, as we preferred in those days.  The Red Age.  The Green Age.  And they are right.  But they are wrong.  It goes back beyond that.  This world was broken long before Rajaat first drew breath.  What makes you believe your minds can carry a burden so ancient without falling to it?"*
* *"If I told you where to find what you seek - the root, the spark - would you leave this place untouched?  Or would your ‘cosmic preservation’ rewrite Athas in the name of balance?"*
* *"You would bind the wounds of a thousand worlds… yet mine is already a scar.  Will you preserve even this — the ash and sun and sorrow - or will you burn it away for something cleaner? Something kinder"*
* *"I have seen tyrants call themselves saviors. I have watched ‘heroes’ drown cities in good intentions.  I am one.  You who walk between worlds - what makes you different?  What makes you better than I?  Why should I let you near the Tower that broke the sky?"*
* *"You’ve seen wonders. Magic without defilement. Civilizations fed by rivers that never die.  When your quest is done — when Vecna is ashes - will you return here?  Will you bring what you’ve learned? Or will you leave us to our drought and dust?"*

Assuming the party does not give terrible answers to his question, Hamanu will think for a moment, then pronounce his judgement.

> Hamanu gazes down upon you from his dais.  His voice, when it comes, echoes not only from his throat but from the polished stone of the chamber walls and the bones of those who stand within them. It is both a command and a decree, heavy with the weight of one who has ruled for ages and intends to rule for ages more.  *"You seek the truth that scorched the skies and bled the seas. The truth that cracked the world and left it gasping beneath the Dark Sun."*
> 
> He step down from the dais, staff in hand, its orb pulsing with a seething orange glow.  *"That truth lies where even I have not trod in an age—the Pristine Tower, where the world was once mended, and then broken again.  Where I was mended and broken again.  And if answers are what you seek, then you will find them there."*
> 
> Hamanu steps toward the party, his eyes radiating intensity, his presence a storm held just barely in check.  *"You will travel as one of mine.  With mine - my Templars.  Sereth will lead you east, through Nibenay, and into the lifeless wastes.  He will lead you to the tower.  And beneath it you will find a chamber.  Built by the halflings in an age long past.  That chamber - the Chamber where Rajaat made us and broke us - has the answers you seek.  And when you find that Chamber you will find a relic.  The Dark Lens of Rajaat.  You will take it with you, and give it to Sereth when you emerge from the tower.  Sereth will return it to me."*
>
> Hamanu's voice becomes as hard as steel.  *"This is the price of my benevolence.  Not because I trust or do not trust you.  Not because I believe you will succeed against your foe, nor because I fear your ultimate failure.  But because I must be ready.  If you fail - if the heavens fracture and your foe tears out the bones of reality Urik will not kneel.  Athas will not kneel.  I will not kneel."*
> 
> There is a moment, then another though - an afterthought, spoken into the air.  *"Even gods and kings must make wagers in strange times."*  The intensity returns.  *"Go.  Urik will tolerate your presence.  Sereth awaits you, to prepare your for the sands."*  With a gesture the chains binding your arms fall away, although those with psionic collars or arcane gags are not freed.

Outside the grand hall Sereth is waiting:

> Outside the ash-armored man - Sereth - waits for you.  He regards you all with something approaching amusement or mirth.  *"Well..."* he says, his tone dry but not unfriendly *"...the King has decided that you're not to be killed.  That makes you rarer than most who arrive in his city uninvited."*  
>
> He steps forward with an easy confidence, examining you as if you were some kind of exotic animal.  *"Outsiders.  Pale as salt, eyes full of distance.  I've no doubt you are capable.  But let me be plain: the sands of Athas are capable too.  And they are very, very old."* 
> 
> He gesture to a table where your clothes - but not your gear - lays next to a dark-laquered tray, upon which rests six ceramic tokens, etched in shimmering gold and obsidian.  *"Those tokens are yours.  It bears the Lion Seal.  It says you serve his will.  Show that to a
