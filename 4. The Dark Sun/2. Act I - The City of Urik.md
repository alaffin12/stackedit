> You stumble, boots striking sun-baked stone, the air immediately thick with dust and heat. Gone is the shimmer of planar energy â€” now, a narrow alley stretches before you, hemmed in by mud-brick walls scorched black by relentless sun. The sky above is not blue, but a pale brass haze, the sun twice as large and three times as cruel.  The very air scrapes at your lungs - dry, bitter, and heavy with ash. A faint stench of sweat, smoke, and something like roasted blood wafts in from nearby streets.  Beneath your feet, even the shadows seem thirsty.

> Somewhere beyond these narrow walls, a city groans in the heat: you hear the bark of a trader, the creak of leather, the low chant of a distant crowd. But here, in this alley - you are alone for now.  Alone in Athas.  And it does not want you here.
