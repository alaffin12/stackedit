# Nibenay
Nibenay marks the halfway point of the party's journey to Pristine Tower, and also a change.  They travelled with a desert caravan here on well-established (if still dangerous) roads.  Hereafter the party will instead be travelling with only Templars and Sereth, and moving as swiftly as possible via crodlu overland towards their target.

> You enter Nibenay - a city of the same stature as Urik (although your Urikite companions would likely dispute that) under the scorching sun of the late afternoon.  The city walls, cyclopean clay mortared stone, are carved with ancient runes and you pass beneath a gate that Sereth informs you is the 'Gate of Earthly Serenity'.  It is flanked on either side by massive stone statues:
> 
> *"They are of Nibenay himself..."* Sereth whispers to you *"...different aspects of his personality, expressed as different physical forms."*  He chuckles.  *"Do not mistake me when I say this - for Hamanu has a mighty ego himself - but among the sorcerer-kings there are none who love to aggrandize themselves as the Shadow King."*
>
> You are escorted by the Templar-Wives of Nibenay - all woman, and Sereth informs you that they all 'marry' Nibenay when they enter the ranks of the Templars, although the nature of that marriage is a subject of much debate - and escorted to "Merchant's Rest" - a walled compound in the city set aside for large caravans and visiting dignitaries.  You are all given medallions - although you note the slaves are different coloured - which identify you as dignitaries and will encourage merchants and citizens alike to treat you with deference, and smooth over any possible conflicts.

Players can explore the city if they wish.  As Urik resembled Ur and Babylon, Nibenay resembles Ankor Wat and the air is constantly filled with strange music and the people behave with odd customs (examples - people will pull one another's hair as a greeting, children carry life-sized straw dolls of their mothers with the, the interior walls of the city are covered in artistic expression -  but as the day passes into the cooler evening a messenger will arrive at the caravan - another Templar-Wife:

> As you linger near the caravan you see a figure crossing the courtyard towards you.  She moves quickly, with a soldier's movements but a dancer's cadence, flanked by two others trailing slightly behind.  She is tall and poised, her yellow and purple robes flowing in layers than shimmer like beaten bronze in the fading light.  The fabric is embroidered with a coiling serpent motif - fangs bared - and she wear a translucent veil the colour of wine, fastened with silver hooks to her earlobes and the tiara she wears upon her brow.  Beneath it you can see the painted kohl around her eyes, making her gaze more intense and unreadable.  She wears a bronze amulet bearing the sigil of Nibenay - a coiled serpent - that hangs above her heart.  Her trailing companions - male, you can see from here - each wear similar, but much simpler robes and no amulet.
> 
> She spares a glance for the Templars and Sereth, but he gaze is mostly focused on you - the party.  *"Outsiders..."* she says, bowing lowly and precisely, her hands outstretched with palms upturned *"...travellers under the Lion's Mark.  I am Sharit of the Ninth Veil, bonded servant and loyal wife to the Shadow King.  I speak now with his voice and by his grace."*
>
>Sharit produces a scroll from beneath the folds of her clothes and opens it, reading from it.  *"His majesty, the King of Obsidian and Silence, has noted your presence.  In accordance with courtesy and curiosity, he invites you to partake of the stillness and stone - to speak with him in the Garden of Stone Whispers."* 
>
>Sharit rolls up the scroll and looks at you expectantly.  *"The Templars of Hamanu, Mighty Lion, are not summoned so.  The invitation extends only to those not born beneath the Dark Sun.  Will you come, strangers?"*
>
>Sereth looks at you all, and you hear his voice in your mind.  *"You must accept, of course.  To do otherwise would be a grave insult, and one must not insult a sorcerer-king lightly - in his own city no less!  Remember - here in Nibenay there is a slavish dedication to protocol and tradition.  They will excuse your ignorance of their ways, but you must show them respect nonetheless.  Especially the sorcerer-king.  And be wary - the King of Shadow offers many gifts and long shadows in which to hide blades.  You are not his to take.*

Sereth will watch as the players are led away by the Templar-Wife and her two (male, eunuch if it comes up) attendants.  The Templar-Wife will lead them through the city, answering any questions they might ask.  Eventually they come to the garden:

> The 'Garden of Stone Whispers' is a small walled garden, but it is remarkable as well.  For beneath the obsidian walls and under the watch of the basalt statues there is green and - more significantly - there is a basalt fountain in the middle of the garden, water happily burbling out of it, filling a small bowl and - since it is not overflowing - you assume disappearing somewhere else.  
>
> A figure sits, staring contemplatively at the waters.  He is large - as large as Hamanu - and his bearing just as regal and as oppressive.  His robes, purple and woven gold, cover him - making him look like an archmage perhaps, or a learned scholar-king.  His crown of gold is large, and simple - stretching to seemingly form horns from his brown.  His flesh is mauve, similar in colour to his robes and when he looks at you the black holes that are his eyes seem to swallow his face.  And then he moves and you realize something else - the figure is not here.  This is merely a projection of his form, as he turns his mind to this place.
> 
> *"Husband..."* the Templar-Wife says quietly *"...your guests."*  She turns to you, bows - as she did when she first greeted you and says *"May you prove worthy of your ancestors, strangers"* and then disappears into the lengthening shadows of the evening.
> 
> Your host - the Shadow King - waits until the Templar has left.  When he speaks the walls shake, but somehow his voice seems quiet, restrained.  *"You are not of this world..."* he says, his eyes returning to the quiet pool *"...your scent is foreign, your shadow lighter.  You have met the lion, and now you meet the serpent.  Tell me strangers - what do you think of this world?  Of us?  I invite you to be honest in your assessment, and open in your words.  I am many things, and perhaps from my wives and my citizens I prefer flattery.  But you are not of this place.  You do not belong.  And from your sight hidden truths might be distilled."*

Nibenay will let them be openly critical of him and Athas.  Some points they might possibly make:

- **On cruelty:** *"The land is cruel.  So do those who dwell in it.  We must all - sorcerer-king and slave alike - survive.  Know that I do not excuse the cruelty.  But I recognize it's function.  Chains are ugly.  But they bind together a broken world.  You see pain.  I see survival, bought at a terrible price."*
- **On Templars:** *"I will not pretend to speak for my fellow sorcerer-kings, although I am virtually certain they would give you the same answer.  My wives act as they do because they follow my orders.  I give my orders out of necessity. They follow for their own reasons, some out of love or devotion, others because they understand.  Others are just happy to be on one side but not the other.  But they all act on my command.  And I command because I see.  I see the price of inaction.  Do you know of Tyr perhaps?  The city without a king?  Kalak was my comrade - the weakest of us, perhaps, but he was one of us.  They celebrated when they cast him down.  And what has their rebellion brought them?  Starvation.  Loss.  Tyranny that wears a new name.  The same chains, only rusted and worn."*
- **On change:** *"Do you think I do not seek change?  A better way?  But my brothers and sisters - the Champions of Rajaat, if you understand that term - were handed a broken world.  We were given a lone tool, one that tears down as much as it builds up.  The water here - it is a triviality.  The water for this city?  The cost is enormous.  In
