# Nibenay
Nibenay marks the halfway point of the party's journey to Pristine Tower, and also a change.  They travelled with a desert caravan here on well-established (if still dangerous) roads.  Hereafter the party will instead be travelling with only Templars and Sereth, and moving as swiftly as possible via crodlu overland towards their target.
