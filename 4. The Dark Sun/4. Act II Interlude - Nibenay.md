# Nibenay
Nibenay marks the halfway point of the party's journey to Pristine Tower, and also a change.  They travelled with a desert caravan here on well-established (if still dangerous) roads.  Hereafter the party will instead be travelling with only Templars and Sereth, and moving as swiftly as possible via crodlu overland towards their target.

> You enter Nibenay - a city of the same stature as Urik (although your Urikite companions would likely dispute that) under the scorching sun of the late afternoon.  The city walls, cyclopean clay mortared stone are carved with ancient runes and you pass beneath a gate that Sereth informs you is the 'Gate of Earthly Serenity'.
