# Nibenay
Nibenay marks the halfway point of the party's journey to Pristine Tower, and also a change.  They travelled with a desert caravan here on well-established (if still dangerous) roads.  Hereafter the party will instead be travelling with only Templars and Sereth, and moving as swiftly as possible via crodlu overland towards their target.

> You enter Nibenay - a city of the same stature as Urik (although your Urikite companions would likely dispute that) under the scorching sun of the late afternoon.  The city walls, cyclopean clay mortared stone, are carved with ancient runes and you pass beneath a gate that Sereth informs you is the 'Gate of Earthly Serenity'.  It is flanked on either side by massive stone statues:
> 
> *"They are of Nibenay himself..."* Sereth whispers to you *"...different aspects of his personality, expressed as different physical forms."*  He chuckles.  *"Do not mistake me when I say this - for Hamanu has a mighty ego himself - but among the sorcerer-kings there are none who love to aggrandize themselves as the Shadow King."*
>
> You are escorted by the Templar-Wives of Nibenay - all woman, and Sereth informs you that they all 'marry' Nibenay when they enter the ranks of the Templars, although the nature of that marriage is a subject of much debate - and escorted to "Merchant's Rest" - a walled compound in the city set aside for large caravans and visiting dignitaries.  You are all given medallions - although you note the slaves are different coloured - which identify you as dignitaries and will encourage merchants and citizens alike to treat you with deference, and smooth over any possible conflicts.

Players can explore the city if they wish, but as the day passes into the cooler evening a messenger will arrive at the caravan - another Templar-Wife:

> As you linger near the caravan you see a figure crossing the courtyard towards you.  She moves quickly, with a soldier's movements but a dancer's cadence, flanked by two others trailing slightly behind.  She is tall and poised, her yellow and purple robes flowing in layers than shimmer like beaten bronze in the fading light.  The fabric is embroidered with a coiling serpent motif - fangs bared - and she wear a translucent veil the colour of wine, fastened with silver hooks to her earlobes and the tiara she wears upon her brow.  Beneath it you can see the painted kohl around her eyes, making her gaze more intense and unreadable.  She wears a bronze amulet bearing the sigil of   Her trailing companions - male, you can see from here - each wear similar, but much simpler robes.
