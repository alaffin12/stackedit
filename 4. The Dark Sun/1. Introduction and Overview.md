When the part returns from Barovia the sanctum will have the next destination for the party

> My mind turns curiously time and again to Athas, the Land of the Dark Sun.
>  
> I have not ventured often to Athas.  It is a grim place, one that has fallen out of balance with itself.  And magic - my weapon and ally - is problematic there.  So I do not often venture to those lands.  
> 
> But in my search for the foundational secrets of the cosmos my mind turns again and again to Athas.  A stubborn world, holding on against its own collapse.  But why is it collapsing?  One might point to the defiling magic wielded by its sorcerer-kings, or the scorching heat of its dying sun.  They might even point to Raajat Warbringer, a figure from their distant history who chained the world.  But those answers are short, limited.  Yes - defiling magic is behind the dying planet and perhaps even its dying sun.  Yes - Raajat introduced defiling magic to the world.  But why has magic failed in Athas?  What happened to it?  I suspect the answer lies back in the depths of its history - back in what the locals call the Blue Age some fourteen thousand years prior.  But where to look and how to find it?  I do not know this answer...

## Outline
Athas is a grim and dark fantasy setting, one where magic is the deadly domain of the sorcerer kings and psionics is the order of the day.  Keep the following in mind in Athas
