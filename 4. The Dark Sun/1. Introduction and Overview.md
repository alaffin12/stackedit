One might point to the defiling magic wielded by its sorcerer-kings, or the scorching heat of its dying sun.  They might even point to Raajat Warbringer, a figure from their distant history who chained the world.  But those answers are short, limited.  Yes - defiling magic is behind the dying planet and perhaps even its dying sun.  Yes - Raajat introduced defiling magic to the world.  But why has magic failed in Athas?  What happened to it?  I suspect the answer lies back in the depths of its history - back in what the locals call the Blue Age some fourteen thousand years prior.  But where to look and how to find it?  I do not know this answer...

## Outline
Athas is a grim and dark fantasy setting, one where magic is the deadly domain of the sorcerer kings and psionics is the order of the day.  Keep the following in mind in Athas:

### Magic - Defiler & Preserver
The flow of magic has been disrupted in Athas, and it is difficult to use even by normally powerful arcane spell-casters.  Defilers are arcane spell-casters who take the easy way out, and draw the power for their magic from the world around them.  This is powerful, but it scars the land - leaving it barren and lifeless.  Preservers, on the other hand, try to maintain the balance of magic - often sacrificing power in the name of a grander purpose.

#### Basics
Each time an arcane spell-caster casts a spell, they must choose if they are defiling or preserving and roll 1d20.

#### Defiling Magic
If the spell-caster chooses to defile and they roll higher than 10 on their 1d20 role they cast the spell without consuming a spell slot.  

### Environment - Hot & Cold
 
### Other Notes
 - Metal is extremely rare in Athas.  Anyone walking around with a lot of it is going to attract a lot of attention.

* Magic can defile or preserve.  The mechanics of these two options are explained below.
* Metal is incredibly rare in Athas, and people walking around with metal armor and with metal weapons are going to attract attention.  
* The oppressive desert heat is omnipresent in At
