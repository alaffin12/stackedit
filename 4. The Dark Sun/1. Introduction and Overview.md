One might point to the defiling magic wielded by its sorcerer-kings, or the scorching heat of its dying sun.  They might even point to Raajat Warbringer, a figure from their distant history who chained the world.  But those answers are short, limited.  Yes - defiling magic is behind the dying planet and perhaps even its dying sun.  Yes - Raajat introduced defiling magic to the world.  But why has magic failed in Athas?  What happened to it?  I suspect the answer lies back in the depths of its history - back in what the locals call the Blue Age some fourteen thousand years prior.  But where to look and how to find it?  I do not know this answer...

## Outline
Athas is a grim and dark fantasy setting, one where magic is the deadly domain of the sorcerer kings and psionics is the order of the day.  Keep the following in mind in Athas:

### Magic - Defiler & Preserver
The flow of magic has been disrupted in Athas, and it is difficult to use even by normally powerful arcane spell-casters.  Defilers are arcane spell-casters who take the easy way out, and draw the power for their magic from the world around them.  This is powerful, but it scars the land - leaving it barren and lifeless.  Preservers, on the other hand, try to maintain the balance of magic - often sacrificing power in the name of a grander purpose.

#### Basics
Each time an arcane spell-caster casts a levelled spell (cantrips do not count), they must choose if they are defiling or preserving and roll 1d20.

#### Defiling Magic
If the spell-caster chooses to defile and they roll higher than 10 on their 1d20 role they cast the spell without consuming a spell slot.  Using defiling magic causes obvious visual cues as the land around the caster turns blackened and lifeless.  The defiler also taints themselves with their fell magic - track the number of times they defile and apply the following:
* For 5+ 'defiles' the defilers max HP is reduced by 1 per 'defile'.
* For 10+ 'defiles' the defilers cannot regain HP for 1 hour after defiling.
* For 15+ 'defiles' the defiler begins to mutate, exhibiting physical signs of the fell magic they use, and will have disadvantage on all charisma check with anyone in Athas not aligned with defilers (i.e. anyone not Templars or Sorcerer-Kings).  
Defilers reduce their number of defiles by 1d4 every long rest.  

#### Preserving Magic
If the spell-caster chooses to preserve and they roll a 1 their 1d20 the spell fizzles and the spell slot is consumed.  If they roll a 2 or a 3 they trigger a wild magic effect (see table below).

| 1d20 | Effect |
| -- | -- |
| 1 | **Brown Tide Echo.** For 1 minute, all plant life in a 30 ft radius rapidly grows.  After 1 minute the plants then rots away, releasing poisonous spores. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Con save or be poisoned for 1 minute. |
| 2 | **Psionic Feedback.** Your spell triggers a psionic shockwave. Each creature within 60 ft (including you) must make a DC 13 Int save or take 2d6 psychic damage and suffer disadvantage on their next Wisdom-based check or save. |
| 3 | **Sandstorm Pulse.** A sudden burst of swirling grit erupts from you. Visibility in a 20 ft radius becomes heavily obscured for 1 minute. |
| 4 | **Temporal Flicker.** You blink out of time. Reappear in your space at the start of your next turn. You are unaware of your surroundings until then.  If someone is standing in your space when you reemerge they are pushed out of your space as the discretion of the DM |
| 5 | **Desert Mirage.** For the next minute, illusory versions of yourself shimmer and shift around you. Attackers have disadvantage on attacks against you, but you suffer disadvantage on your own attack rolls as well. |
| 6 | **Primal Howl.** A long-dead elemental spirit cries out through your spell. All creatures within 15 ft must succeed on a DC 14 Wis save or be frightened of you until the end of their next turn. |
| 7 | **Cracked Earth.** The ground beneath your feet fractures. A 10-foot radius becomes difficult terrain, and any creature starting its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Dex save or fall prone. |
| 8 | **Eyes of the Sorcerer-Kings.** You feel the gaze of a Sorcerer-King upon you. For 1 minute, your thoughts are open to scrying. A powerful psychic entity may attempt contact. |
| 9 | **Ash Cloud.** our spell emits a choking plume of ash. All creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 12 Con save or cough violently, suffering disadvantage on Concentration checks for 1 minute. |
| 10 | **Reverse Defiling.** The land heals briefly around you. Any defiled terrain within 20 ft is restored, small flora sprouts instantly, and you regain 1d6 HP. |
| 11 | **Corrupted Spellform.** Your spell partially transforms. Roll 1d4: 1–Fire, 2–Cold, 3–Lightning, 4–Necrotic. Your spell deals this damage type instead of its usual type. |
| 12 | **Mind Warp.** Roll a d6. On a 1–3, you gain the effects of the *Confusion* spell until the end of your next turn. On a 4–6, you can cast *Detect Thoughts* without components as a bonus action. |
| 13 | **Unstable Channeling.** he spell is amplified. If it requires a saving throw, targets roll at disadvantage.  If it requires an attack roll you make it at advantage. However, you also take 1d6 force damage. |
| 14 | **Veil of the Blue Age.** For 1 minute, your appearance flickers to resemble an ancient lifeshaper. Beasts and elementals are friendly to you during this time unless harmed. |
| 15 | **Shadow of Rajaat.** A smoky, hulking silhouette appears briefly behind you. Creatures within 10 ft must succeed on a DC 13 Wis save or become unnerved, taking 1d4 psychic damage and losing their reaction for the round. |
| 16 | **Blackened Touch.** The next creature you touch before the end of your next turn becomes defiled — it cannot regain HP until it finishes a short rest.  If you do not touch another creature you instead cannot regain HP until you finish a long rest. |
| 17 | **Wild Psionics** – You gain resistance to psychic damage for 1 minute |
| 18 | **Oasis Bloom.** A 10-ft-radius area of sand around you briefly transforms into a lush oasis. It lasts 12 hours, provides clean water, and grants anyone resting in it advantage on Constitution saves to resist exhaustion.
| 19 | **Spell Echo.** The spell casts again at the start of your next turn with no cost or action, targeting the same point or creature. If the original spell was area-based, it targets a random nearby creature instead. |
| 20 | **Lifeshaper’s Mark.** You gain an ethereal tattoo of the Blue Age. For the next hour, you may cast one spell without expending a spell slot, but doing so causes defiling regardless of your choice. |

### Environment - Hot & Cold
 The environment of Athas is a dire one, with scorching hot days alternating with bitterly cold nights.  

**While in the cities:** Players will have to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw once a day to maintain their fitness.  Players who spend most of their day in medium or heavy armour have disadvantage on this save.  Players who have resistance to fire or cold damage, or whose background would suggest a reason to be adapted to the desert life can make this save with advantage.  On a failure the player gets one level of exhaustion.

**While travelling:** Travelling is harder.  Every short rest players must make a DC 20 Constitution save against heat stroke.  Players who spend their time travelling in medium or heavy armour, or who did not prepare adequately to travel in the desert, take disadvantage on this save.  Players who are resistant to fire damage automatically make this save.  On a failure the player takes a level of exhaustion.  During the long rest players must make a DC 15 Constitution save against the cold of the desert night.  Players who did not prepare adequately to travel in the desert take disadvantage on this save.  Players who are resistant to cold damage automatically make this save.  On a failure the player takes a level of exhaustion.

### The Gods of Athas
There are no gods.  That does not mean that divine spellcasters are out of luck - their connection to their gods is deep enough that they will still be able to make contact.  But Athas changes their magic too.

The first time a divine spell-caster casts a spell ask them which of the four classical elements they feel the strongest affinity for in the moment.  Then consult the table below:

| Spell Type | Affinity | Opposed | Neutral 1 | Neutral 2 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **Healing** | **WATER** – Spell restores +1 HP per spell level or ends 1 extra condition if applicable. | **FIRE** – Healing reduced by 1 HP per spell level (min 1); flames flicker across target’s skin painfully | **EARTH** – The healed area gains barklike texture; skin hardens, briefly | **AIR** – Target exhales mist or fog; healing feels “light” and distant |
| **Protection** | **EARTH** – Target gains +1 to Strength saves for 1 minute or resistance to being shoved | **AIR** – Target’s hair floats, aura feels unstable; Bless/Shield of Faith may flicker for a round (disadvantage on 1 concentration save) | **WATER** – Buff feels "soothing"; the target feels calm or sedated | **FIRE** – Buff feels hot and surging; target has glowing veins, drawing attention |
| **Damage** | **FIRE** – +1 damage per die for spells dealing fire, radiant, or necrotic damage (only 1 spell per round) | **WATER** – First damage die is halved (min 1); wet air or rain-like sizzle mutes the attack | **AIR** – Attack surges forward with a gust or whistling sound | **EARTH** – Ground trembles, rocks erupt around target (harmlessly) |
| **Divination** | **AIR** – Gain advantage on 1 Int or Wis check related to the spell’s purpose (e.g., Insight, Perception, Arcana) | **EARTH** – Spell has a 1-round delay (you learn info on next turn); or you get only partial answer at first | **WATER** – Images appear as ripples in water or reflected light | **FIRE** – Sparks leap around your eyes; info received feels overwhelming or painful briefly 

Initially players will be able to choose their element, but eventually the DM will be an element they have the strong affinity with and will make them stay with it.

### Other Notes
 - Metal is extremely rare in Athas.  Anyone walking around with a lot of it is going to attract a lot of attention.

## The Story as Planned
The party arrives in the city of Urik in the middle of the day, the scorching temperatures immediately disorienting them.  Under the hot sun they are allowed to wander briefly before they are set upon by Templars and Psions in the employ of Hamanu, the Sorcerer-King of Urik.  The Psions will disable the party (most will go down without a save against the unfamiliar power wielded by the Psions, although if their ba
