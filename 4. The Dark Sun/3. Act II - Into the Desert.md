# Into the Desert
### Cast of Characters
#### Sereth the Mindspike
An amused academic, loyal servant of King Hamanu and a powerful psionic warrior, Sereth ostensibly commands the caravan, although the King has bid him to follow the party's will on the road.  Sereth serves a narrative role, to act as a bridge between the players and the world of Athas.
