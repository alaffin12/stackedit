## Route
Although the players are nominally 'in command' of the caravan Sereth and the other Templars have done most of the preparation for the trip (given the party's general inexperience with Athas).  The plan is to travel by the trade roads as a caravan to Nibenay, passing through Silver Spring (on the third day), Shazlim (on the fifth day) and Fort Isus (on the seventh day) before reaching their destination on the ninth day.  In Nibenay the slaves and one of the Templars (Rahlis, if he survives) will stay behind and re-provision for the journey back to Urik.  Meanwhile Crodlu will be purchased in Nibenay and used to head out over land to the ESE.  From there the party will pass through Fort Inix (four days after leacing Nibenay) and Cleft Rock Well (six days after leaving Nibenay).  The Pristine Tower is one days travel after Cleft Rock Well - the Templars will travel but at about halfway to their destination they too will turn around and return to the Cleft Rock Well, leaving the party and Sereth to finish the journey.

| Silver Spring | 3 |
| Shazlim | 2 |
| Fort Isus | 2 |
| Nibenay | 2 |
| Fort Inix | 4 |
| Cleft Rock Well | 2 |
| The Pristine Tower | 1 |

## Caravan Journey
As the players journey they will have to make decisions about the condition of the caravan and manage the morale of both the Templar Soldiers and the Slaves that accompany them.  The caravan starts out with 380 units of food and 380 units of water.  To survive, a character must consume at least one unit of food and one unit of water per day - otherwise they will take disadvantage on their survival roles to withstand the desert heat.
