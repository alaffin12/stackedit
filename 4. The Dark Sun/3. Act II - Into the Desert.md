## Route
Although the players are nominally 'in command' of the caravan Sereth and the other Templars have done most of the preparation for the trip (given the party's general inexperience with Athas).  The plan is to travel by the trade roads as a caravan to Nibenay, passing through Silver Spring (on the third day), Shazlim (on the fifth day) and Fort Isus (on the seventh day) before reaching their destination on the ninth day.  In Nibenay the slaves and one of the Templars (Rahlis, if he survives) will stay behind and re-provision for the journey back to Urik.  Meanwhile Crodlu will be purchased in Nibenay and used to head out over land to the ESE.  From there the party will pass through Fort Inix (four days after leacing Nibenay) and Cleft Rock Well (six days after leaving Nibenay).  The Pristine Tower is one days travel after Cleft Rock Well - the Templars will travel but at about halfway to their destination they too will turn around and return to the Cleft Rock Well, leaving the party and Sereth to finish the journey.  

| Location | Time From Last (Days) |
| -- | -- |
| Urik | *Start* |
| Silver Spring | 3 |
| Shazlim | 2 |
| Fort Isus | 2 |
| Nibenay | 2 |
| Fort Inix | 4 |
| Cleft Rock Well | 2 |
| The Pristine Tower | 1 |

## Caravan Journey
As the players journey they will have to make decisions about the condition of the caravan and manage the morale of both the Templar Soldiers and the Slaves that accompany them.  The caravan starts out with 380 units of food/water.  The Templars start with a morale of 4, while the slaves start with a morale of 5.  To survive, a character must consume at least one unit of food and one unit of water per day - otherwise they will take disadvantage on their survival roles to withstand the desert heat.  Every day the party must decide how to feed the Templars and the Slaves as well as themselves:

| Ration Plan | Ration Cost per person | Morale Effect |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Lean | -1 food/water | -1 morale |
| Normal | -2 food/water | *No effect* |
| Generous | -3 food/water | +1 morale |
| Feast | -5 food/water | +2 morale |

Additionally there are some other rules to consider.  First, the Templars believe they are *better* than the Slaves.  They will take a -1 to their morale if the slaves are given better rations than they are.  Further, since the party and Sereth are their leaders, they will take a -1 hit to their morale if the party/Sereth are given worse rations than the other Templars.  Finally, the slaves will gain a morale if they see the party and Sereth eating less than they are - they believe that their masters care about them.

At night the party will also have the opportunity to improve morale with role play.  There are also random events which may effect morale/supplies (use the average of the Templar/Slave morale rounded down to determine the appropriate table to roll on):

| Roll | Low Morale (<4) | 
| -- | -- |
| 1 | *Argument in Camp.* A fight breaks out between two slaves.  -1 slave morale | 
| 2 | *Sabotage.* Someone left some of the supplies out where it was taken by the pack animals.  -10 food/water | 
| 3 | *Desertion.* Some slaves decide to take their chances with the sands.  -1 slave morale and lose 1d2 slaves unless the party makes a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check | 
| 4 | *Rumours.*  Word around camp is that the outsiders are cursed.  -1 slave morale unless a PC makes a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check |

| 6 | *Theft.* A slave steals food and water.  -10 food/water |

| 9 | *Death of a Slave.* A slave dies.  -1 slave.  -1 slave morale unless the party performs an act of compassion | 
| 10 | *False Alarm.* A templar raises the alarm during the night, but it's just a bone lizard.  Still, no one sleeps well that night.  -1 templar morale | 
| 11 | *Lost Hope.* A slave open questions the caravan's survival.  Other mutter.  -1 morale unless someone makes a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. |

| 9 | *Leaky Crate.* A crate leaks.  -10 food/water. |

| 12 | Nothing | 

### Encounter - The Warden of Salt
>It is your third day in this heat-soaked land and while Sereth assures you that the caravan is getting close to somewhere at least nominally 'alive' you have a hard time believing anything lives out in this sandy hell.  Even the gentle breeze from the movement of the wagon feels like heat blasting against you skin.  
>
> You pass along a small canyon, the wheels of your caravan crunch as they break through the thin crust of crystal that cover the ground here.  Salt.  You imagine this was once a river or an inlet of some sort, that became a salt-flat when the oceans dried.  It doesn't matter really - the desert is littered with places like this.  Places where all the life has been sucked from a land, leaving it nothing but grit and heat.  The animals don't seem to mind.  Maybe the slaves, who often drop off the wagon to attend to some problem or another.  But you try really hard to not think too much about their plight.
>
> As you move along you hear a shout from one of the Outriders.  You don't understand it - the Templars all seem to insist on speaking in Urikite - but it quickly gets Sereth to his feet, looking around.  Soon he sees what the warning was about - an old man, treading barefoot and scraggly along the salt-basin.  *"A defiler..."* Sereth grumbles.  Before you can ask Sereth explains: *"Defilers - you have heard the word before, no?  A magus who drains life from the world in order to fuel his magic.  This one is old.  Likely mad and dangerous.  Do you want me to order the Templars to kill him?"*

Players can attack the Defiler outright, or can talk to him.  If they choose to talk:

> The old man - his bones decrepit, his body misshapen - looks up at you.  "I am the Salt Warden.  I serve a penance here to pay for the crimes of my youth.  Those who pass this trail must pay a price, not of silver or iron.  A price of yesterday and tomorrow.  A memory of joy to sustain me in this barren waste.  Tell me - will you pay, or will you allow your soul to shrivel?"

If a player donates a memory of joy they lose all their memories of that event, but more importantly: -2 morale templars (should have let the slaves do it), +1 morale slaves (happy they didn't have to do it).

If a templar donates a memory of joy: -3 morale templars (should have let the slaves do it, betrayal), +1 morale slaves (happy they did not have to do it)

If a slave donates a memory of joy: -3 morale slaves (didn't want to do it)

If the party refuses or tries to kill the defiler - a fight breaks out, as the Defiler summons dark, salt based creatures to assist him.  A battle ensues, which we theatre of the mind.  To generate the outcomes simply roll 1d100 for the templars, the slaves and the supplies and then add 10*[(Current Morale)-5] to the roll (for supplies choose the lowest morale)

**Templars**
| d100 | Result | 
| -- | -- |
| 1-10 | 2 templars killed, -3 templar morale |
| 11-30 | 1 templar killed, -2 templar morale |
| 31-60 | Uninjured, None |
| 61-90 | Uninjured,  Templars rally.  +1 templar morale |
| 91-100 | Uninjured,  Templars impress with their combat prowess.  +2 templar morale |

**Slaves**
| d100 | Result | 
| -- | -- |
| 1-10 | 6 slaves dead, -3 slave morale |
| 11-30 | 3 slaves dead, -2 slave morale |
| 31-60 | 1 slave dead, -1 slave morale |
| 61-90 | Minor Injuries, +1 slave morale |
| 91-100 | No injuries, +2 slave morale |

**Supplies**
| d100 | Result | 
| -- | -- |
| 1-10 |  -38 food/water |
| 11-30 |  -19 food/water |
| 31-60 |  -10 food water |
| 61-90 |  Nothing |
| 91-100 | Extra food found +10 food/water |

### Waypoint - Silver Spring
Silver Spring is run by the Silver Hand elf tribe, who guard the oasis.  If asked about them Sereth will respond that they have a reputation for charging high prices and demanding ridiculous fees for their 'protection', but that they are fundamentally running a business - if they sell you something you will get what you paid them for.  Even if you pay through the nose for it. There are a handful of things for the party to consider at Silver Spring

#### Buy Supplies
Silver Spring has water and food to sell.  The water is cloudy and tastes off, but it is potable.  The food is old and just this side of spoiled, but it is edible.  Prices are ten times higher than they are in Urik - the Silver Hand has a monopoly in the area, and they know it.  A single unit of food/water costs a piece of silver (or 1000 bits) - it would cost a piece of copper (or 100 bits) in Urik.  However, since the food and water is not pristine some of the Templars might not be happy about having to consume it.  Here is the outcome of the various ways the players can proceed and the effects on morale:

| Option | Templar Morale | Slave Morale |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Buy nothing | No change | No change |
| Buy food for everyone | -1 | No change |
| Buy food for slaves only | No change | -1 |
| Buy food for templars only | -2 | +1 |

#### Silver Spring Defenses
The Silver Hand Elves have set up rudimentary defenses around Silver Spring, ostensibly for protecting caravans that stop there.  Caravans are free to sleep outside the defenses if they wish, but if they wish to st
