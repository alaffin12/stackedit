# Into the Desert
### Cast of Characters
#### Sereth the Mindspike
Human, Male.  An amused academic, loyal servant of King Hamanu and a powerful psionic warrior, Sereth ostensibly commands the caravan, although the King has bid him to follow the party's will on the road.  Sereth serves a narrative role, to act as a bridge between the players and the world of Athas.

#### Jekkas
Mul, male. Stoic and broad-shouldered, with a shaven head and branded cheeks. Rarely speaks, but observes everything. Carries the heaviest loads (save for Borun) without complaint.

#### Soola
Human, female.  Wiry and light-footed despite a twisted left foot. Always humming, she’s quick and dependable. Known for her bright woven sash.

#### Talmet
Elf, male.  Bitter and quick-tongued. Sold into slavery after cheating in a caravan race. Constantly complaining, but clever with knots and lashings.
 
#### Reeva
Halfling, female. Gentle and observant, speaks softly to beasts and humans alike. Often seen stroking the muzzles of the inixes.

#### Borun
Half-Giant, male. Towering and quiet, with a scar down one arm and a broken nose. Rumored to be an ex-gladiator. Carries double what others can.
    
-   **Kashan** _(Human, male)_ – Just thirteen years old, skittish but eager. Carries light loads and helps fetch water. Stares wide-eyed at the adventurers.
