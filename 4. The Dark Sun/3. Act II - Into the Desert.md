## Route
Although the players are nominally 'in command' of the caravan Sereth and the other Templars have done most of the preparation for the trip (given the party's general inexperience with Athas).  The plan is to travel by the trade roads as a caravan to Nibenay, passing through Silver Spring (on the third day), Shazlim (on the fifth day) and Fort Isus (on the seventh day) before reaching their destination on the ninth day.  In Nibenay the slaves and one of the Templars (Rahlis, if he survives) will stay behind and re-provision for the journey back to Urik.  Meanwhile Crodlu will be purchased in Nibenay and used to head out over land to the ESE.  From there the party will pass through Fort Inix (four days after leacing Nibenay) and Cleft Rock Well (six days after leaving Nibenay).  The Pristine Tower is one days travel after Cleft Rock Well - the Templars will travel but at about halfway to their destination they too will turn around and return to the Cleft Rock Well, leaving the party and Sereth to finish the journey.  

| Location | Time From Last (Days) |

| Silver Spring | 3 |
| Shazlim | 2 |
| Fort Isus | 2 |
| Nibenay | 2 |
| Fort Inix | 4 |
| Cleft Rock Well | 2 |
| The Pristine Tower | 1 |

## Caravan Journey
As the players journey they will have to make decisions about the condition of the caravan and manage the morale of both the Templar Soldiers and the Slaves that accompany them.  The caravan starts out with 380 units of food/water.  The Templars start with a morale of 4, while the slaves start with a morale of 5.  To survive, a character must consume at least one unit of food and one unit of water per day - otherwise they will take disadvantage on their survival roles to withstand the desert heat.  Every day the party must decide how to feed the Templars and the Slaves as well as themselves:

| Ration Plan | Ration Cost per person | Morale Effect |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Lean | -1 food/water | -1 morale |
| Normal | -2 food/water | *No effect* |
| Generous | -3 food/water | +1 morale |
| Feast | -5 food/water | +2 morale |

Additionally there are some other rules to consider.  First, the Templars believe they are *better* than the Slaves.  They will take a -1 to their morale if the slaves are given better rations than they are.  Further, since the party and Sereth are their leaders, they will take a -1 hit to their morale if the party/Sereth are given worse rations than the other Templars.  Finally, the slaves will gain a morale if they see the party and Sereth eating less than they are - they believe that their masters care about them.

At night the party will also have the opportunity to improve morale with role play.  There are also random events which may effect morale/supplies (use the average of the Templar/Slave morale rounded down to determine the appropriate table to roll on):

| Roll | Low Morale (<4) | 
| -- | -- |
| 1 | *Argument in Camp.* A fight breaks out between two slaves.  -1 slave morale | 
| 2 | *Sabotage.* Someone left some of the supplies out where it was taken by the pack animals.  -1 food/water | 
| 3 | *Desertion.* Some slaves decide to take their chances with the sands.  -1 slave morale and lose 1d2 slaves unless the party makes a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check |

### Encounter - The Salt Warlock
>It is your third day in this heat-soaked land and while Sereth assures you that the caravan is getting close to somewhere at least nominally 'alive' you have a hard time believing anything lives out in this sandy hell.  Even the gentle breeze from the movement of the wagon feels like heat blasting against you skin.  
>
> You pass along a small canyon, the wheels of your caravan crunch as they break through the thin crust of crystal that cover the ground here.  Salt.  You imagine this was once a river or an inlet of some sort, that became a salt-flat when the oceans dried.  It doesn't matter really - the desert is littered with places like this.  Places where all the life has been sucked from a land, leaving it nothing but grit and heat.
>
> As you move along you hear a shout from one of the Outriders.  You don't understand it - the Outriders seem to insist in speaking to one another in a language
