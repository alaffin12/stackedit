# Into the Desert
### Cast of Characters
### Templars
#### Sereth the Mindspike
Human, Male.  An amused academic, loyal servant of King Hamanu and a powerful psionic warrior, Sereth ostensibly commands the caravan, although the King has bid him to follow the party's will on the road.  Sereth serves a narrative role, to act as a bridge between the players and the world of Athas.

#### High Templar Maerik of the Obsidian Brand
Human, Male.  Commander.  Harsh but effective. Views the party with suspicion, but follows the King's orders to the letter. Doesn't like Sereth's rather loose, non-military approach to matters, but respects his ability.  Speaks in clipped, military tones.

#### Templar Rahlis
Mul, Male.  Enforcer.  Loves inflicting pain “in the name of order.”

#### Templar Nyla
Elf, Female.  Scout.  Aloof and pragmatic.  Rarely speaks.

#### Templar Velkan 
Human, Male.  Logistician.  Methodical and curious.  Secretly fascinated by the party

#### Templar Korva
Half-Giant, Female.  Heavy Infantry.  Blunt and humorless.  Zealous, even for a Templar.



### Porters (Slaves)
#### Jekkas
Mul, male. Stoic and broad-shouldered, with a shaven head and branded cheeks. Rarely speaks, but observes everything. Carries the heaviest loads (save for Borun) without complaint.

#### Soola
Human, female.  Wiry and light-footed despite a twisted left foot. Always humming, she’s quick and dependable. Known for her bright woven sash.

#### Talmet
Elf, male.  Bitter and quick-tongued. Sold into slavery after cheating in a caravan race. Constantly complaining, but clever with knots and lashings.
 
#### Reeva
Halfling, female. Gentle and observant, speaks softly to beasts and humans alike. Often seen stroking the muzzles of the inixes.

#### Borun
Half-Giant, male. Towering and quiet, with a scar down one arm and a broken nose. Rumored to be an ex-gladiator. Carries double what others can.
    
#### Kashan
Human, male. Just thirteen years old, skittish but eager. Carries light loads and helps fetch water. Stares wide-eyed at the adventurers.

### Animal Handlers & Drivers (Slaves)
#### Dren
Dwarf, male. Weathered and sun-browned. He swears constantly at the animals but tends to them like old friends.

#### Mera
Mul, female. Silent, serious, with a burned right arm. She works the mekillots with practiced precision. Keeps to herself.

#### Akro
Halfling, male. Twitchy and always talking. Terrified of the larger beasts, but knows the breeding lines of inixes by heart.

#### Lenya
Human, female. Lean and sunburnt, with a leather whip coiled at her hip. The senior handler, she tolerates no disobedience—from beast or slave.

#### Korrel
Elf, male. Slippery and charming. Often fakes injuries to avoid hard labor. Somehow always ends up with the lightest job.

### Attendants (Slaves)
#### Hela
Human, female. Tall, graceful, and composed. Specializes in massage and basic medicine. Has strange glyphs tattooed on her neck.

#### Tyvek
Dwarf, male. Elderly, with calloused hands and a white beard braided into a knot. Still steady with a salve and needle.

### Labourers (Slaves)
#### Treshi
Human, female. Wide-eyed and enthusiastic. Never seen the desert before and treats the caravan like an adventure. Fascinated by the party.

#### Bozan
Dwarf, male. Grizzled and toothless, but still strong. He’s the camp cook, and grumbles constantly about the lack of spice.

#### Zerra
Elf, female. Fast and foul-mouthed. Has a knack for setting up tents in storms. Claims she once served a noble family in Nibenay.

#### Nimel
Human, male. Timid and soft-spoken, always hurrying to avoid notice. He keeps the fires stoked and water boiling.

#### Vennas
Mul, male. Middle-aged and muscular. Once worked in obsidian mines. Stubborn, quiet, and efficient.

#### Ciri
Elf, female. Quick-witted and pretty, often used as an attendant for high Templars. Knows how to listen without appearing to eavesdrop.

#### Yat
Half-Giant, male. Mute, but deeply expressive. Carries messages and is used as a living wall when needed. Some say he’s smarter than he lets on.
