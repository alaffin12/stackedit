# Into the Desert
### Cast of Characters
### Templars
#### Sereth the Mindspike
Human, Male.  An amused academic, loyal servant of King Hamanu and a powerful psionic warrior, Sereth ostensibly commands the caravan, although the King has bid him to follow the party's will on the road.  Sereth serves a narrative role, to act as a bridge between the players and the world of Athas.

### Porters (Slaves)
#### Jekkas
Mul, male. Stoic and broad-shouldered, with a shaven head and branded cheeks. Rarely speaks, but observes everything. Carries the heaviest loads (save for Borun) without complaint.

#### Soola
Human, female.  Wiry and light-footed despite a twisted left foot. Always humming, she’s quick and dependable. Known for her bright woven sash.

#### Talmet
Elf, male.  Bitter and quick-tongued. Sold into slavery after cheating in a caravan race. Constantly complaining, but clever with knots and lashings.
 
#### Reeva
Halfling, female. Gentle and observant, speaks softly to beasts and humans alike. Often seen stroking the muzzles of the inixes.

#### Borun
Half-Giant, male. Towering and quiet, with a scar down one arm and a broken nose. Rumored to be an ex-gladiator. Carries double what others can.
    
#### Kashan
Human, male. Just thirteen years old, skittish but eager. Carries light loads and helps fetch water. Stares wide-eyed at the adventurers.

### Animal Handlers & Drivers (Slaves)
-   **Dren** _(Dwarf, male)_ – Weathered and sun-browned. He swears constantly at the animals but tends to them like old friends.
    
-   **Mera** _(Mul, female)_ – Silent, serious, with a burned right arm. She works the mekillots with practiced precision. Keeps to herself.
    
-   **Akro** _(Halfling, male)_ – Twitchy and always talking. Terrified of the larger beasts, but knows the breeding lines of inixes by heart.
    
-   **Lenya** _(Human, female)_ – Lean and sunburnt, with a leather whip coiled at her hip. The senior handler, she tolerates no disobedience—from beast or slave.
