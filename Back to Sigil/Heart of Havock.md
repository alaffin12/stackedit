# Heart of Havock

Though much of the god-corpse of Havock is petrified and crumbling, the god’s heart still beats. Over time, the heart spawned a parasitic monstrosity known as a hertilod, which feasts on the god’s residual divine power and terrorizes hapless astral travelers who stumble on Havock’s corpse. When the  Lambent Zenith  crashed into Havock's corpse, the god’s heart began absorbing pieces of the ship’s prow, and the hertilod gorged itself on the spelljamming vessel’s detritus—including the spelljamming helm.

## General Features

The areas of the heart of Havock have the following notable features:

**Foul Air.**  The air throughout the heart is foul. Any creature that breathes the foul air has the poisoned condition until it breathes fresh air again.

**Lighting.**  All areas inside the heart are dimly lit by floating orbs of pinkish bioluminescence.

**Walls, Ceiling, and Floor.**  The walls, ceiling, and floor of the heart are made of purple flesh. Parts of this flesh have been petrified, hardening into gray crystal, while other parts remain soft and spongy. The heart beats erratically, sending a dull pulse echoing through its chambers every few minutes. The ceilings in the heart are all 50 feet high.

## Areas of the Heart

The areas of the heart are keyed to the Heart of Havock map.

### A1: Entry Atrium

> Beyond the shattered safe room is an oval chamber with walls of purple flesh dimly lit by pinkish, bioluminescent orbs. The air reeks of death. An opening in one wall leads to another chamber.

**Treasure.**  The heart absorbed detritus from the wreckage of the Lambent Zenith’s safe room and bridge. A character who searches through the detritus and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check uncovers a gilded spyglass worth 1,000 gp.

### A2: Ventricle Chamber

> The walls and floor of this massive chamber alternate between gray, petrified stone and flexing muscle and flesh. Clinging to the ceiling is a serpentine monstrosity, like a skinless snake. Its long, draconic snout drips with venom as it slumbers.

The creature sleeping on the ceiling is the  **[hertilod](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-NvrXNHSu_TW8FxVE02D)**  that swallowed the spelljamming helm. A character can move through the area without waking the hertilod by succeeding on a DC 18 Dexterity (Stealth) check. Otherwise, the hertilod wakes when it detects a creature within 30 feet of itself and attacks.

**Retrieving the Spelljamming Helm.**  The  helm  is deep within the hertilod’s gullet. If the hertilod is forced to regurgitate creatures in its gullet, roll a d6. On a roll of 4 or higher, the helm is also regurgitated and lands in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of the hertilod. Alternatively, a creature within the hertilod’s gullet can use its action to make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, finding the helm on a successful check. Once the hertilod is dispatched, a character can easily recover the rod piece from the hertilod’s gullet. 

**Caved-In Artery.**  A 10-foot-wide petrified artery leads from this chamber. The artery has caved in, blocking that exit from the chamber.

A character who uses an action to dig through the cave-in can make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the character clears a passage through the cave-in large enough for a Medium creature to squeeze through. Exiting the heart through this passage leads to the area above the  Lambent Zenith’s prow.

### A3: Flooded Atrium

> The air here is humid. Pooled on the floor is black sludge that shimmers like an oil slick.

A character who examines the sludge and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies it as Havock’s blood. A creature that touches the blood immediately takes 10 (3d6) force damage. For each minute a creature spends in contact with the blood, the creature takes this damage again.

**Caved-In Artery.**  A 10-foot-wide petrified artery leads from this chamber. The artery has caved in, blocking that exit from the chamber. Characters can clear that exit as described in area A2.
